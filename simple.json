I lost no time in acquainting my father with this, and telling him that I felt quite prepared, and meant to offer myself. Accordingly, on the day appointed, your humble servant, with some fourteen or fifteen other youthful aspirants, assembled on board the flag-ship. Each was dressed out in our No. I suits, in most exact and unquizzable uniform, with a large bundle of log-books under our arms. We were all huddled together in a small screened canvas cabin, like so many sheep ready for slaughter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAbout eleven o'clock, the captains who were to be our Minos and our Rhadamanthus, made their appearance, and we all agreed that we did not much like the \"cut of their jibs.\" At twelve o'clock the first name was called. The \"desperate youth\" tried to pluck up a little courage—he cleared his throat, pulled up his shirt collar, touched his neck-handkerchief, and seizing his cocked hat and journals, boldly followed the messenger into the captain's cabin, where three grave-looking gentlemen, in undress uniform, awaited him. They were seated at a round table; a clerk was at the elbow of the president; Moore's navigation, that wise redoubtable, lay before them; together with a nautical almanack, a slate and pencil, ink and paper. The trembling middy advanced to the table, and having most respectfully deposited his journals and certificates of sobriety and good conduct, was desired to sit down. The first questions were merely theoretical; and although in the gun-room, or in any other company, he would have acquitted himself with ease, he was so abashed and confounded, that he lost his head entirely, trembled at the first question, stared at the second, and having no answer to make to the third, was dismissed, with directions \"to go to sea six months longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eHe returned to us with a most woe-begone countenance. I never saw a poor creature in greater mental torment. I felt for him the more, as I knew not how soon his case might be my own. Another was called, and soon returned with no better success; and the description he gave of the bullying conduct of the youngest passing captain was such as to damp the spirits, and enough to stultify minds so inexperienced as ours, and where so much depended on our success. This hint was, however, of great use to me. Theory, I found, was the rock on which they had split; and in this part of my profession, I knew my powers, and was resolved not to be bowled out by the young captain. But while I thus resolved, a third candidate was returned to us&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003ere infecta\u003c/i\u003e; and this was a young man on whose talents I could have relied: I began to doubt myself. When the fourth came out with a smiling face, and told us he had passed, I took a little breath; but even this comfort was snatched from me in a moment, by his saying that one of the passing captains was a friend of his father. Here then was solved an enigma; for this fellow, during the short time I was in his company, gave proof of being no better than a simpleton.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eOn my own name being called, I felt a flutter about the heart which I did not feel in action, or in the hurricane, or when, in a case more desperate than either, I jumped overboard at Spithead, to swim to my dear Eugenia. \"Powers of Impudence, as well as Algebra,\" said I, \"lend me your aid, or I am undone.\" In a moment the cabin door flew open, the sentinel closed it after me, and I found myself in the presence of this most awful triumvirate. I felt very like Daniel in the lions' den. I was desired to take a chair, and a short discussion ensued between the judges, which I neither heard nor wished to hear: but while it lasted, I had time to survey my antagonists from head to foot. I encouraged myself to think that I was equal to one of them; and if I could only neutralise him, I thought I should very easily floor the other two.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eOne of these officers had a face like a painted pumpkin; and his hand, as it lay on the table, looked more like the fin of a turtle; the nails were bitten so close off, that the very remains of them seemed to have retreated into the flesh, for fear of farther depredation, which the other hand was at the moment suffering. Thinks I to myself, \"If ever I saw 'lodgings to let, unfurnished,' it is in that cocoa-nut, or pumpkin, or gourd of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe next captain to him was a little, thin, dark, dried up, shrivelled fellow, with keen eyes, and a sharp nose. The midshipmen called him \"Old Chili Vinegar,\" or, \"Old Hot and Sour.\" He was what we term a martinet. He would keep a man two months on his black list, giving him a breech of a gun to polish and keep bright, never allowing him time to mend his clothes, or keep himself clean, while he was cleaning that which, for all the purposes of war, had better have been black. He seldom flogged a man; but he tormented him into sullen discontent, by what he called \"keeping the devil out of his mind.\" This little night-mare, who looked like a dried eel-skin, I soon found was the leader of the band.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe third captain was a tall, well-looking, pompous man (he was the junior officer of the three), with a commanding and most unbending countenance: \"He would not ope his mouth in way of smile, though Nestor swore the jest was laughable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI had just time to finish my survey, and form a rough estimate of the qualities of my examiners, when I was put upon my trial by the president, who thus addressed me,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"You are perfect in the theory of navigation, I presume, Sir, or you would not come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI replied, that I hoped I should be found so, if they would please to try me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Ready enough with his answer,\" said the tall captain; \"I daresay this fellow is jaw-master-general in the cockpit.—Who did you serve your time with, Sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI stated the different captains I had served with, particularly Lord Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Oh, ay, that's enough; you&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003emust\u003c/i\u003e&nbsp;be a smart fellow, if you have served with Lord Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI understood the envious and sarcastic manner in which this was uttered, and prepared accordingly for an arduous campaign, quite sure that this man, who was no seaman, would have been too happy in turning back one of Lord Edward's midshipmen. Several problems were given to me, which I readily solved, and returned to them. They examined my logs and certificates with much seeming scrutiny, and then ventured a question in the higher branches of mathematics. This I also solved; but I found talent was not exactly what they wanted. The little skinny captain seemed rather disappointed that he could not find fault with me. A difficult problem in spherical trigonometry lay before them, carefully drawn out, and the result distinctly marked at the bottom; but this I was not, of course, permitted to see. I soon answered the question; they compared my work with that which had been prepared for them; and as they did not exactly agree, I was told that I was wrong. I was not disconcerted, and very deliberately looking over my work, I told them I could not discover any error, and was able to prove it by inspection, by Canon, by Gunter, or by figure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"You think yourself a very clever fellow, I dare say,\" said the little fat captain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"A second Euclid!\" said the tall captain. \"Pray, Sir, do you know the meaning of&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e'\u003ca class=\"extiw\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons_Asinorum\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; color: #3366cc; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration-line: none; vertical-align: baseline;\" title=\"w:Pons Asinorum\"\u003ePons Asinorum\u003c/a\u003e?'\u003c/i\u003e\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Bridge of Asses, Sir,\" said I, staring him full in the face, with a smile under the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eNow it was very clear to me that the little fat captain had never heard of the Asses Bridge before, and therefore supposed I was quizzing the tall captain, who, from having been what we used to term a \"harbour-duty man\" all his life, had heard of the&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003ePons Asinorum\u003c/i\u003e, but did not know which of the problems of Euclid it was, nor how it was applicable to navigation.

I took her into dock, and saw her coppered; took her along the sheer-hulk, masted her; laid her to the ballast-wharf, took in and stowed her iron ballast and her tanks; moved off to a hulk or receiving ship, rigged her completely, bent her sails, took in guns, stores, and provisions; reported her ready for sea, and made the signal for a pilot; took her out of harbour, and was desired to conduct her into other harbours, pointing out the shoals and dangers of Portsmouth, Plymouth, Falmouth, the Downs, Yarmouth Roads, and even to Shetland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eBut the little martinet and the tall captain had not forgiven me for being right in the problem, and my examination continued. They put my ship into every possible situation which the numerous casualties of a sea life present in such endless variety. I set and took in every sail, from a sky-sail to try-sail. I had my masts shot away, and I rigged jury-masts: I made sail on them, and was getting fairly into port, when the little martinet very cruelly threw my ship on her beam-ends on a dead lee-shore, a dark night, and blowing a hurricane, and told me to get her out of that scrape if I could. I replied that, if there was anchorage, I should anchor, and take my chance; but if there was no anchorage, neither he nor any one else could save the ship, without a change of wind, or the special interference of Providence. This did not satisfy old Chili Vinegar. I saw that I was persecuted, and that the end would be fatal to my hopes: I therefore became indifferent; was fatigued with the endless questions put to me; and, very fortunately for me, made a mistake, at least in the opinion of the tall captain. The question at that time was one which was much controverted in the service; namely, whether, on being taken flat aback, you should put your helm a turn or two alee, or keep it amidship? I preferred the latter mode; but the tall captain insisted on the former, and gave his reasons. Finding myself on debatable ground, I gave way, and thanked him for his advice, which I said I should certainly follow whenever the case occurred to me; not that I felt convinced then, and have since found that he was wrong; still my apparent tractability pleased his self-love, and he became my advocate. \"He grinned horribly a ghastly smile,\" and, turning to the other captains, asked if they were satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis question, like the blow of the auctioneer's hammer, ends all discussion; for captains, on these occasions, never gainsay each other; I was told that my passing certificate would be signed.

We were all astonished, and inquired what questions were put to him; he said, \"None at all, except as to the health of my father and mother; and whether I would have port or white wine and water.

One good effect resulted from my long examination, which continued an hour and a half—this was, that the captains passed all the other midshipmen with very few questions. They were tired of their employment; and thus it was only the poor unlucky devils that took off the fiery edge of their morning zeal, who suffered; and among \"the plucked,\" it was known there were much cleverer fellows than many of those who had come off with flying colours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThere was one circumstance which amused me.

My reception was kind and affectionate; but death had made sad havoc in my family during my late absence. My elder brother and two sisters had been successively called to join my poor mother in heaven, and all that remained now to comfort my father was a younger sister and myself. I must confess that my father received me with great emotion; his own heavy afflictions from the loss of his children, and the dangers I had undergone, as well as the authentic assurances he had received of my good conduct were more than sufficient to bury all my errors in oblivion; and he appeared, and I have no doubt really was, fonder and prouder of me than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAs to what my own feelings were on this occasion, I shall not attempt to disguise them. Sorry I certainly was for the death of my nearest relatives; but when the intelligence reached me, I was in the midst of the most active service. Death in all its forms had become familiar to me; and so little impression did the event make on my mind, that I did not interrupt the thread of my history to speak of it when it occurred. I take shame to myself for not feeling more; but I am quite sure, from this one instance in my life, that the feelings are blunted in proportion to the increase of misery around us; that the parent who, in a moment of peace and domestic tranquillity, would be agonized at the loss of one child, would view the death of ten with comparative indifference, when surrounded by war, pestilence, or famine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eMy feelings, never very acute in this respect, were completely blunted by my course of life. Those fond recollections which, in a calm scene, would have wrung from me some tears to their memory, were now drowned or absorbed in the waste, the profligacy, and the dissipation of war; and shall I add, that I easily reconciled myself to a loss which was likely so much to increase my worldly gain. For my eldest brother, I own that, even from childhood, I had felt a jealousy and dislike, fostered, as I think, in some measure unwisely, and in part unavoidably, by the conduct of my parents. In all matters of choice or distinction, Tom was to have the preference, because he was the oldest: this I thought hard enough; but when Tom had new clothes at Midsummer and Christmas, and his old ones were converted to my use, I honestly own I wished the devil had Tom. As a point of economy, perhaps, this could not be avoided; but it engendered a hatred towards my brother which often made me, in my own little malignant mind, find excuses for the conduct of Cain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eTom was, to be sure, what is called a good boy;&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003ehe\u003c/i\u003e&nbsp;never soiled his clothes, as I did.

When I went to sea, I ceased to think about them, concluding there was no love lost; but when I found that death had for ever robbed me of two of them, I felt the irretrievable loss. I reproached myself with my coldness and neglect; and the affection I had denied to them, I heaped threefold on my remaining sister: even before I had ever seen her on my return, the tide of fraternal love flowed towards her with an uncontrollable violence. All that I ought to have felt towards the others, was concentrated in her, and displayed itself with a force which surprised even myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003ePerhaps the reader may be astonished that my first inquiry in London, when I had seen my father and my family, should not have been after poor Eugenia, whom I had left, and who also had quitted me, under such very peculiar and interesting circumstances.

I did go, without loss of time, to her agent; and all that my most urgent entreaty could obtain from him was that she was well; that I still had credit at his house for any sum I chose to draw for in moderation; but that her place of abode must, till farther orders from her, remain a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAs my father did not want interest, and my claims were backed by good certificates, I received my commission as a lieutenant in his Majesty's navy about a fortnight after my arrival in London; but not being appointed to any ship, I resolved to enjoy the \"\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background: none; border-bottom-color: cornflowerblue; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-image: initial; border-left-color: initial; border-left-style: initial; border-right-color: initial; border-right-style: initial; border-top-color: initial; border-top-style: initial; border-width: 0px 0px thin; cursor: help; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\" title=\"otium cum dignitate: leisure with dignity\"\u003eotium cum dig\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/i\u003e,\" and endeavour to make myself some amends for the hard campaign I had so lately completed in North America.

My personal advantages were heightened by the utmost attention to dress; the society of the fair Acadians had very much polished my manners, and I had no more of the professional roughness of the sea than what, like the crust on the port-wine, gave an agreeable flavour; my countenance was as open and as ingenuous as my heart was deceitful and desperately wicked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eEmily rose with much agitation, and in an instant was clasped in my arms: not that the movement was voluntary on her part; it was wholly on mine. She rather recoiled; but for an instant seemed to have forgotten the fatal communication which her father had made to her not two hours before. She allowed me—perhaps she could not prevent it—to press her to my heart. She soon, however, regained her presence of mind, and, gently disengaging herself, gave vent to her feelings in a violent flood of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eNot at the time recollecting the conversation with my father, much less suspecting that Emily had been made acquainted with it, I cannot but confess that this reception surprised me.

The fair sex will start at this proposition; but it is nevertheless true. Emily was to me what the Dutchman's best anchor was to him—he kept it at home, for fear of losing it. He used other anchors in different ports, that answered the purpose tolerably well; but this best bower he always intended to ride by in the Nieu deep, when he had escaped all the dangers and quicksands of foreign shores: such was Emily to me. I thought of her when in the very jaws of the shark; I thought of her when I mounted the rigging in the hurricane; I thought of her when bored and tormented to madness by the old passing captains; all, all I might gain in renown was for her. Why, then, traitor like, did I deny her? For no other reason that I can devise than that endless love of plot and deceit which had \"grown with my growth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eMadame de Stael has pronounced love to be an episode in a man's life; and so far it is true. There are as many episodes in life as there are in novels and romances; but in neither case do they destroy the general plot of the history, although they may, for the time, distract or divert our attention. Here, then, is the distinction between passion and love. I felt a passion for Eugenia, love for Emily. And why? Because although it was through my own persuasions and entreaties that her scruples had been overcome; although it was through her affection for me which would not allow her to refuse me any demand, even to the sacrifice of herself, that Eugenia had fallen, still, in the eyes of society, she had fallen; and I did not offer up a pure and holy love to that which was not accounted pure. In this I gave way, ungratefully, to the heartless casuistry of the world. But Emily, enshrined in modesty, with every talent, equal, if not superior charms, defended by rank and connection, was a flower perpetually blooming on the stem of virtue, that it would have amounted to sacrilege to attempt to have plucked; and the attempt itself would have savoured of insanity, from the utter hopelessness of success. Every sentiment connected with her was pure, from mere selfishness. Not for worlds would I have injured her; because in destroying her peace of mind, my own would have fled for ever. When I contemplated our final union, I blushed for my own unworthiness; and looked forward to the day when, by repentance and amendment, I might be deemed worthy to lead her to the altar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI had not time to pursue these reflections any farther.

Guilty, and convicted on the clearest evidence, I had nothing left for it, but to throw myself on her mercy; but while I stood undecided, and unknowing what to do, Mr Somerville entered, and welcomed me with kind, but cool hospitality.

I can only trust to your patient hearing, while I state the real facts. Allow me first to say, that my father's observations are hardly warranted by the conversation which took place; and if you will please, in the first place, to consider that that very conversation originated in my expressing a wish and intention of coming down to see you, and to produce to your daughter the memento so carefully guarded during my long absence, you must perceive that there is an incongruity in my conduct, difficult to explain; but still, through all these mazes and windings, I trust that truth and constancy will be found at the bottom. You may probably laugh at the idea, but I really felt jealous of my father's praises so lavishly bestowed on Miss Somerville; and not supposing he was aware of my attachment, I began to fear he had pretensions of his own. He is a widower, healthy, and not old; and it appeared to me that he only wanted my admiration to justify his choice of a step-mother for myself and sister. Thus, between love for Miss Somerville, and respect for my father, I scarcely knew how to act. That I should for one moment have felt jealous of my father, I now acknowledge with shame: yet labouring under the erroneous supposition of his attachment to an object which had been the only one of my adoration, I could not make up my mind to a disclosure, which I feared would have renewed our differences, and produced the most insuperable bars to our future reconciliation. This thought burned in my brain, and urged the speed of the jaded post-horses. If you will examine the drivers, they will tell you, that the whole way from town, they have been stimulated by the rapping of a Spanish dollar on the glass of the chaise. I dreaded my father getting the start of me; and busy fancy painted him, to my heated imagination, kneeling at the feet of my beloved Emily. Condemn me not, therefore, too harshly; only allow me the same lenient judgment which you exercised when I first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis last sentence delicately recalled the scene at the inn, and the circumstances of my first introduction. The defence was not bad; it wanted but one simple ingredient to have made it excellent—I mean truth; but the court being strongly biassed in favour of the prisoner, I was acquitted, and at the same time, \"admonished to be more careful in future.\" The reconciliation produced a few more tears from my beloved Emily, who soon after slipped out of the room to recover her flurry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWhen Mr Somerville and myself were left together, he explained to me the harmless plot which had been laid for the union between his daughter and myself.

We sat but a short time over our wine, as I preferred following my mistress to the little drawing-room, where tea and coffee were prepared, and where the musical instruments were kept. Emily sang and played to me, and I sang and accompanied her; and I thought all the clocks and watches in the house were at least three hours too fast, when, as it struck twelve, the signal was made to retire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI had no sooner laid my head on my pillow than I began to call myself to a severe account for my duplicity; for, somehow or other, I don't know how it is, conscience is a very difficult sort of gentleman to deal with. A tailor's bill you may avoid by crossing the channel; but the duns of conscience follow you to the antipodes, and will be satisfied. I ran over the events of the day; I reflected that I had been on the brink of losing my Emily by an act of needless and unjustifiable deceit and double-dealing. Sooner or later I was convinced that this part of my character would be made manifest, and that shame and punishment would overwhelm me in utter ruin. The success which had hitherto attended me was no set-off against the risk I ran of losing for ever this lovely girl, and the respect and esteem of her father. For her sake, therefore, I made a vow for ever to abandon this infernal system. I mention this more particularly as it was the first healthy symptom of amendment I had discovered, and one to which I long and tenaciously adhered, as far, at least, as my habits and pursuits in life would allow me. I forgot, at that time, that to be ingenuous it was necessary to be virtuous. There is no cause for concealment when we do not act wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eA letter from Mr Somerville to my father explained my conduct; and my father, in reply, said I certainly must have been mad.

The more I saw of Emily, the firmer and faster did she rivet my chains. I was her slave: but what was best, I became a convert to virtue, because she was virtuous; and to possess her, I knew I must become as like her as my corrupt mind and unruly habits would permit. I viewed my past life with shame and contrition. When I attended this amiable, lovely creature to church on a Sunday, and saw her in the posture of devotion before her Maker, I thought her an angel, and I thought it heaven to be near her. All my thoughts and sentiments seemed changed and refined by her example and her company. The sparks of religion, so long buried in the ashes of worldly corruption and infidelity, began to revive. I recalled my beloved mother and the Bible to my recollection; and could I have been permitted to have remained longer with my \"governess,\" I have no doubt that I should have regained both purity of mind and manner. I should have bidden adieu to vice and folly, because they could not have dwelt under the same roof with Emily; and I should have loved the Bible and religion, because they were beloved by her: but my untoward destiny led me a different way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"__center_block\" style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; display: table; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px auto; max-width: 70%; padding: 0px; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; width: auto;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14.4px; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 17.28px; margin: 0px; padding: 0.5em 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"poem\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e&nbsp; And oft his smooth and bridled tongue\u003cbr /\u003e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would give the lie to his flushing cheek:\u003cbr /\u003e&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a coward to the strong:\u003cbr /\u003e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a tyrant to the weak.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px -2em 0px 0px; padding: 0em 0px 0px; text-align: right; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSHELLEY.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: small-caps; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eMy\u003c/span\u003e&nbsp;father, as soon as he had obtained my promotion, asked for my being employed; and having had a promise from the Admiralty, that promise, unlike thousands of its predecessors and successors, was too rapidly fulfilled.

He did not even live there, but generally resided on board.

Seeing I was an officer, I was admitted alongside; so I paid the waterman, and sent him away. As I went up the side, I saw a poor fellow spread-eagled up to the grating, \"according to the manners and customs of the natives,\" while the captain, officers, and ship's company stood round witnessing the athletic dexterity of a boatswain's mate, who, by the even, deep, and parallel marks of the cat on the white back and shoulders of the patient, seemed to be perfectly master of his business.

I watched the countenance of the captain, and the peculiar expression, which I could not decipher at my first interview, I now read most plainly: it was malignant cruelty, and delight in torturing his own species; he seemed to take a diabolical pleasure in the hateful operation which we were compelled to witness.

He next rolled up his shirt-sleeves above his elbow, and showed an arm and a back very like the Farnese Hercules, which, no doubt, all my readers have seen at the foot of the staircase at Somerset-house, when they have been to the exhibition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis hopeful commentator on articles of war, seized his cat: the handle was two feet long, one inch and three quarters thick, and covered with red baize. The tails of this terrific weapon were three feet long, nine in number, and each of them about the size of that line which covers the springs of a travelling carriage. Mr Pipes, whose scientific display in this part of his art, had no doubt procured for him the warrant of a boatswain, in virtue of which he now stood as the vindicator of the laws of his country, handled his cat like an adept, looked at it from top to bottom, cleared all the tails, by the insertion of his delicate fingers, and combing them out, stretched out his left leg—for he was left-legged as well as left-handed—and measuring his distance with the accurate eye of an engineer, raised his cat high in air with his left hand, his right still holding the tips of the tails, as if to restrain their impatience; when, giving his arm and body a full swing, embracing three-fourths of the circle, he inflicted a tremendous stroke on the back of the unfortunate culprit. This specimen seemed to satisfy the amateur captain, who nodded approbation to the inquiring look of the amateur boatswain. The poor man lost his respiration from the force of the blow; and the tails of the cat coming from an opposite direction to the first four dozen, cut the flesh diamond-wise, bringing the blood at every blow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI will not wound the feelings of my readers with a description of the poor wretch's situation.

My resistance to the brutality of our common taskmaster had pleased them; they told me what a tyrant and what a disgrace to the service he was, and how shameful it was that he should be entrusted with the command of so fine a vessel, or of any vessel at all, except it were a convict ship. The stories they told me of him were almost incredible, and nothing but the too well founded idea, that an officer trying his captain by a court-martial, had a black mark against him for ever after, and was never known to rise, could have saved this man from the punishment he so richly deserved: no officer, they said, had been more than three weeks in the ship, and they were all making interest to leave her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eIn my report of what occurred in this vessel during the time I belonged to her, I must, in justice to the captains and commanders of his Majesty's navy observe, that the case was unique of its kind—such a character as Captain G—— was rarely met with in the navy then, and, for reasons which I shall give, will be still more rare in future. The first lieutenant told me that I had acted very judiciously in resisting at first his undue exertion of authority; that he was at once a tyrant, a bully, and a coward, and would be careful how he attacked me again. \"But be on your guard,\" said he, \"he will never forgive you; and, when he is most agreeable, there is the most mischief to be dreaded. He will lull you into security, and, whenever he can catch you tripping, he will try you by a court-martial. You had better go on shore, and settle all your business, and, if possible, be on board before your leave is out. It was only your threat of writing to the port-admiral that procured you leave of absence. You have nothing to thank him for: he would have kept you on board if he dared. I have never quitted the ship since I joined her; and never has a day passed without a scene similar to what you have this morning witnessed.

The lashings were no sooner cast off, than a spare top-mast fell and killed one of the men. This was enough to have completed our mischief for the day; but the devil had not done with us yet. The booms were secured, and the men were ordered to rattle the rigging down, which, as the vessel continued to roll heavily, was still more dangerous, and, if possible, more useless than the former operation. He was warned of it, but in vain; and the men had not been aloft more than ten minutes, when one of them fell overboard. Why I should again have put my life in jeopardy, particularly after the warning of the last voyage, I know not. I was perhaps vain of what I could do in the water. I knew my powers; and with the hope of saving this unfortunate victim to the folly and cruelty of the captain, I plunged after him into the sea, feeling at the same time, that I was almost committing an act of suicide. I caught hold of him, and for a time supported him; and, had the commonest diligence and seamanship been shewn, I should have saved him. But the captain, it appeared, when he found I was overboard, was resolved to get rid of me, in order to save himself: he made use of every difficulty to prevent the boat coming to me. The poor man was exhausted: I kept myself disengaged from him, when swimming round him; supported him occasionally whenever he was sinking; but, finding at last that he was irrecoverably gone—for though I had a firm hold of him, he was going lower and lower—and, looking up, perceiving I was so deep that the water was dark over my head, I clapped my knees on his shoulders, and, giving myself a little impetus from the resistance, rose to the surface. So much was I exhausted, that I could not have floated half a minute more, when the boat came and picked me up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe delay in heaving the ship to, I attributed to the scene I had witnessed the night before; and in this, I was confirmed by the testimony of the officers.

He continued the same tyrannical conduct, and I had resolved that the moment we fell in with the admiral to write for a court-martial on this man, let the consequences be what they might: I thought I should serve my country and the navy by ridding it of such a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSeveral of the officers were under arrest, and notwithstanding the heat of their cabins in that warm climate, were kept constantly confined to them with a sentinel at the door. In consequence of this cruel treatment, one of the officers became deranged. We made Barbadoes, and running round Needham's Point into Carlisle Bay, we saw to our mortification, that neither the admiral nor any ship of war was there, consequently our captain was commanding officer in the port. Upon this, he became remarkably amiable, supposing if the evil day was put off, it would be dispensed with altogether; he treated me with particular attention, hoped we should have some fun ashore; as the admiral was not come in, we should wait for him; tired of kicking about at sea, he should take all his&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eduds\u003c/i\u003e, with him, and bring himself to an anchor on shore, and not come afloat again till we saluted his flag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eNeither the first lieutenant nor myself believed one word of this; indeed, we always acted upon the exact reverse of what he said; and it was well we did so in this instance. After we had anchored, he went ashore, and in about an hour returned, and stated that the admiral was not expected till next month; that he should, therefore, go and take up his quarters at Jemmy Cavan's, and not trouble the ship any more until the admiral arrived; he then left us, taking his trunk and all his dirty linen, dirty enough it was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSome of the officers unfortunately believed that we were to remain, and followed the captain's example by sending their linen on shore to be washed.

This was one of his tricks. He had received his orders when he landed in the morning; they were waiting for him, and his coming on board for his things, was only a run to throw us off our guard, and I suppose compel us, by the loss of our clothes, to be as dirty in appearance as he was himself, \"but he always liked to make his officers comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe arrived at Nassau, in New Providence, without any remarkable incident, although the service continued to be carried on in the same disagreeable manner as ever. I continued, however, to get leave to go on shore; and finding no prospect of bringing the captain to justice, determined to quit the ship, if possible. This was effected by accident, otherwise I should have been much puzzled to have got clear of her. I fell between the boat and the wharf as I landed, and by the sudden jerk ruptured a small blood-vessel in my chest; it was of no great importance in itself, but in that climate required care, and I made the most of it. They would have carried me on board again, but I begged to be taken to the hotel. The surgeon of the regiment doing duty there attended me, and I requested him to make my case as bad as possible. The captain came to see me—I appeared very ill—his compassion was like that of the Inquisitor of the Holy Office, who cures his victim in order to enable him to go through further torments. His time of sailing arrived, and I was reported to be too ill to be removed. Determined to have me, he prolonged his stay. I got better; the surgeon's report was more favourable; but I was still unwilling to go on board. The captain sent me an affectionate message, to say that if I did not come, he would send a file of marines to bring me: he even came himself and threatened me; when, finding there were no witnesses in the room, I plainly told him that if he persisted in having me on board, it would be to his own destruction, for that I was fully determined to bring him to a court-martial for drunkenness and unofficerlike conduct, the moment we joined the admiral. I told him of the state in which I had found him. I recapitulated his blasphemies, and his lubberly conduct in losing the two men; he stared and endeavoured to explain; I was peremptory, and he whined and gave in, seeing he was in my power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Well then, my dear fellow,\" said Jacky, \"since you are so very ill—sorry as I shall be to lose you—I must consent to your staying behind.

I have already said, that he was an unique. Impressment and the want of officers at the early part of the war, gave him an opportunity of becoming a lieutenant; he took the weak side of the admiral to obtain his next step, and obtained the command of a sloop, from repeated solicitation at the Admiralty, and by urging his claims of long servitude. The service had received serious injury by admitting men on the quarter-deck from before the mast; it occasioned there being two classes of officers in the navy—namely, those who had rank and connections, and those who had entered by the \"hawse-holes,\" as they were described. The first were favoured when young, and did not acquire a competent knowledge of their duty; the second, with few exceptions, as they advanced in their grades, proved, from want of education, more and more unfit for their stations. These defects have now been remedied; and as all young men who enter the service must have a regular education, and consequently be the sons of gentlemen, a level has been produced, which to a certain degree precludes favouritism, and perfectly bars the entrance to such men as Captain&nbsp;\u003cspan class=\"nowrap\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: nowrap;\"\u003eG——\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAfter the battle of Trafalgar, when England and Europe were indebted for their safety to the British fleet, the navy became popular, and the aristocracy crowded into it. This forwarded still more the melioration of the service, and under the succeeding naval administration, silent, certain, and gradual improvements, both in men, officers, and ships, took place. Subsequently, the navy has been still more fortunate, in having an officer called to its councils, whose active and constant employment at sea, previous to the peace of Paris, had given him a thorough insight into its wants and abuses. Unconnected with party, and unawed by power, he has dared to do his duty; and it is highly to the credit of the first lord, who has so long presided at the board, that the suggestions of this officer have met with due consideration; I can therefore assure my reader, that as long as his advice is attended to, he need be afraid of meeting with no more Captain&nbsp;\u003cspan class=\"nowrap\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: nowrap;\"\u003eG——'s\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"__center_block\" style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; display: table; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px auto; max-width: 70%; padding: 0px; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; width: auto;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14.4px; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 17.28px; margin: 0px; padding: 0.5em 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThere she goes, brimful of anger and jealousy.

The officers of the regiment quartered there, kindly invited me to join their mess; and the colonel enhanced the value of the offer by assigning for me good apartments in the barracks. I was instantly removed to cleanly and comfortable lodgings. I soon regained my strength, and was able to sit at the table, where I found thirty-five young officers, living for the day, careless of the morrow; and, beyond that never bestowing a thought. It is a singular fact, that where life is most precarious, men are most indifferent about its preservation; and, where death is constantly before our eyes, as in this country, eternity is seldom in our thoughts: but so it is; and the rule extends still further in despotic countries. Where the union between the head and shoulders may be dissolved in a moment by the sword of a tyrant, life is not so valued, and death loses its terrors; hence the apathy and indifference with which men view their executioners in that state of society. It seems as if existence, like estates, was valuable in proportion to the validity of the title-deeds by which they are held.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eTo digress no more. Although I was far from being even commonly virtuous, which is about tantamount to absolute wickedness, I was no longer the thoughtless mortal I had ever been since I left school. The society of Emily, and her image graven on my heart; the close confinement to the brig, and the narrow escape from death in the second attempt to save the poor sailor's life, had altogether contributed their share to a kind of temporary reformation, if not to a disgust to the coarser descriptions of vice. The lecture I had received from Emily on deceit, and the detestable conduct of my last captain, had, as I thought, almost completed my reformation. Hitherto I felt I had acted wrong, without having the power to act right. I forgot that I had never made the experiment. The declaration of Captain G.'s atheism was so far from converting me, that from that moment I thought more seriously than ever of religion. So great was my contempt for his character, that I knew whatever he said must be wrong, and, like the Spartan drunken slave, he gave me the greatest horror of vice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSuch was my reasoning, and such my sentiments, previous to any relapse into sin or folly. I knew its heinousness. I transgressed and repented; habit was all-powerful in me; and the only firm support I could have looked to for assistance was, unfortunately, very superficially attended to. Religion, for any good purposes, was scarcely in my thoughts. My system was a sort of Socratic heathen philosophy—a moral code, calculated to take a man tolerably safe through a quiet world, but not to extricate him from a labyrinth of long-practised iniquity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe thoughtless and vicious conduct of my companions became to me a source of serious reflection. Far from following their example, I felt myself some degrees better than they were; and in the pride of my heart thanked God that I was not like these publicans. My pharisaical arrogance concealed from me the mortifying fact that I was much worse, and with very slight hopes of amendment. Humility had not yet entered my mind; but it was the only basis on which any religious improvement could be created—the only chance of being saved. I rather became refined in vice, without quitting it. Gross and sensual gratification, so easily obtained in the West Indies, was disgusting to me; yet I scrupled not to attempt the seduction of innocence, rather more gratified in the pursuit than in the enjoyment, which soon palled, and drove me after other objects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI had, however, little occasion to exert my tact in this art in the Bahama Islands, where, as in all the other islands of the West Indies, there is a class of women, born of white fathers and mustee or mulatto women, nearly approaching in complexion to the European; many of them are brunettes, with long black hair, very pretty, good eyes, and often elegant figures. These ladies are too proud of the European blood in their veins to form an alliance with any male who has a suspicion of black in his genealogical table; consequently they seldom are married unless from interested motives, when, having acquired large property by will, they are sought in wedlock by the white settlers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSo circumstanced, these girls prefer an intercourse with the object of their choice to a legal marriage with a person of inferior birth; and, having once made their selection, an act of infidelity is of rare occurrence among them.

For a whole fortnight, my domestic peace was interrupted either by tears, or by the most voluble and outrageous solos, for I never replied after the first day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eA little female slave, one morning, made me a signal to follow her to a retired part of the garden.

I sat down carelessly, humming a tune, with my face to a mirror, and my back to Carlotta, so that I was able to watch her motions without her perceiving it. She was standing near the fireplace, the coffee was by her, on the table, and the old woman crouched in the chimney corner, with her bleared eyes fixed on the embers. Carlotta seemed in doubt; she pressed her hands forcibly on her forehead; took up the coffee-pot to pour me out a cup, then sat it down again; the old woman muttered something in their language; Carlotta stamped with her little foot, and poured out the coffee. She brought it to me—trembled as she placed it before me—seemed unwilling to let go her hold, and her hand still grasped the cup, as if she would take it away again. The old woman growled and muttered something, in which I could only hear the name of her rival mentioned. This was enough: the eyes of Carlotta lighted up like a flame; she quitted her hold of the salver, retreated to the fireplace, sat herself down, covered her face, and left me, as she supposed, to make my last earthly repast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Carlotta,\" said I, with a sudden and vehement exclamation.

It was Obeah!\" (She started at the name.) \"He told me not to drink coffee this morning, but to make the old woman drink it.\" At these words the beldam sprang up. \"Come here, you old hag,\" said I. She approached trembling, for she saw that escape from me was impossible, and that her guilt was detected. I seized a sharp knife, and taking her by her few remaining grey and woolly hairs, said, \"Obeah's work must be done: I do not order it, but he commands it; drink that coffee instantly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSo powerful was the name of Obeah on the ear of the hag, that she dreaded it more than my brandished knife.

Of this, however, I had no fears, having by degrees discontinued my visits to the young lady who had been the cause of our fracas; and I never afterwards, while on the island, gave Carlotta the slightest reason to suspect my constancy.

A curious circumstance occurred during my stay on this island, and which, beyond all doubt, was connected with the adventures of those extraordinary people, known by the appellation of Buccaneers. Some workmen were digging near the foot of the hill under the fort, when they discovered some quicksilver, and on inspection, a very considerable quantity was found; it had evidently been a part of the plunder of the pirates, buried in casks or skins, and these having decayed, the liquid ore naturally escaped down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThough not indifferent to the pleasures of the table, I was far from resigning myself to the Circean life led by the generality of young military men in the Bahamas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe education which I had received, and which placed me far above the common run of society in the colonies, induced me to seek for a companion whose mind had received equal cultivation; and such a one I found in Charles ——, a young lieutenant in the —— regiment, quartered at Nassau. Our intimacy became the closer, in proportion as we discovered the sottish habits and ignorance of those around us. We usually spent our mornings in reading the classic authors with which we were both familiar; we spouted our Latin verses; we fenced; and we amused ourselves, occasionally, with a game of billiards, but never ventured our friendship on a stake for money. When the heat of the day had passed off, we strolled out, paid a few visits, or rambled over the island; keeping as much aloof from the barracks as possible, where the manner of living was so very uncongenial to our notions. The officers began their day about noon, when they sat down to breakfast; after that, they separated to their different quarters, to read the novels, with which the presses of England and France inundated these islands, to the great deterioration of morals. These books, which they read lounging on their backs, or laid beside them and fell asleep over, occupied the hottest part of the day; the remainder, till the hour of dinner arrived, was consumed in visiting and gossiping, or in riding to procure an appetite for dinner. Till four in the morning, their time was wholly devoted to smoking and drinking; their beds received them in a state of intoxication more or less; parade, at nine o'clock, forced them out with a burning brain and parched tongue; they rushed into the sea, and found some refreshment in the cool water, which enabled them to stand upright in front of their men; the formal duty over, they retired again to their beds, where they lay till noon, and then to breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSuch were their days; can it be wondered at that our islands are fatal to the constitution of Europeans, when this is their manner of life in a climate always disposed to take advantage of any excess?

Four or five of these receptacles was thought a moderate number. Such was the fatal apathy in which these officers existed, that the approach, nay; even the certainty of death, gave them no apparent concern, caused no preparation, excited no serious reflection. They followed the corpse of a brother-officer to the grave in military procession.

It was not deep. As we stood above, on the promontory, we could see the bottom in every part. Under the little headland, which formed the opposite side of the cove, there was a cavern, to which, as the shore was steep, there was no access but by swimming, and we resolved to explore it. We soon reached its mouth, and were enchanted with its romantic grandeur and wild beauty. It extended, we found, a long way back, and had several natural baths, into all of which we successively threw ourselves, each, as they receded farther from the mouth of the cavern, being colder than the last. The tide, it was evident, had free ingress, and renewed the water every twelve hours. Here we thoughtlessly amused ourselves for some time, quoting Acis and Galatea, Diana, and her nymphs, and every classic story applicable to the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAt length, the declining sun warned us that it was time to take our departure from the cave, when, at no great distance from us, we saw the back, or dorsal fin of a monstrous shark above the surface of the water, and his whole length visible beneath it. We looked at him and at each other with dismay, hoping that he would soon take his departure, and go in search of other prey; but the rogue swam to and fro, just like a frigate blockading an enemy's port, and we felt, I suppose, very much as we used to make the French and Dutch feel last war, at Brest and the Texel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe sentinel paraded before us, about ten or fifteen yards in front of the cave, tack and tack, waiting only to serve one, if not both of us, as we should have served a shrimp or an oyster. We had no intention, however, in this, as in other instances, of \"throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\" In vain did we look for relief from other quarters; the promontory above us was inaccessible; the tide was rising, and the sun touching the clear blue edge of the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI, being the leader, pretended to a little knowledge in ichthyology, and told my companion that fish could hear as well as see, and that therefore the less we said the better; and the sooner we retreated out of his sight, the sooner he would take himself off. This was our only chance, and that a poor one; for the flow of the water would soon have enabled him to enter the cave and help himself, as he seemed perfectly acquainted with the locale, and knew that we had no mode of retreat but by the way we came. We drew back, out of sight; and I don't know when I ever passed a more unpleasant quarter of an hour. A suit in Chancery, or even a spring lounge in Newgate, would have been almost luxury to what I felt when the shades of night began to darken the mouth of our cave, and this infernal monster continued to parade, like a water-bailiff, before its door. At last, not seeing the shark's fin above water, I made a sign to Charles that, coûte qui coûte, we must swim for it; for we had notice to quit, by the tide; and if we did not depart, should soon have an execution in the house. We had been careful not to utter a word; and, silently pressing each other by the hand, we slipped into the water; when, recommending ourselves to Providence, which, for my part, I seldom forgot when I was in imminent danger, we struck out manfully. I must own I never felt more assured of destruction, not even when I swam through the blood of the poor sailor; for then the sharks had something to occupy them, but here they had nothing else to do but to look after us. We had the benefit of their undivided attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eMy sensations were indescribably horrible. I may occasionally write or talk of the circumstance with levity, but whenever I recall it to mind, I tremble at the bare recollection of the dreadful fate that seemed inevitable. My companion was not so expert a swimmer as I was, so that I distanced him many feet, when I heard him utter a faint cry. I turned round, convinced that the shark had seized him, but it was not so; my having left him so far behind had increased his terror, and induced him to draw my attention. I returned to him, held him up, and encouraged him. Without this, he would certainly have sunk; he revived with my help, and we reached the sandy beach in safety, having eluded our enemy; who, when he neither saw or heard us, had, as I concluded he would, quitted the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eOnce more on terra firma, we lay gasping for some minutes before we spoke. What my companion's thoughts were, I do not know; mine were replete with gratitude to God, and renewed vows of amendment; and I have every reason to think, that although Charles had not so much room for reform as myself, his feelings were perfectly in unison with my own. We never afterwards repeated this amusement, though we frequently talked of our escape, and laughed at our terrors; yet on these occasions our conversation always took a serious turn: and, upon the whole, I am convinced that this adventure did us both a vast deal of good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI had now been six months in these islands, had perfectly recovered my health, and became anxious for active employment.

I accordingly made hasty preparations for my departure; took leave of all my kind friends at the barracks, for kind indeed they were to me, although thoughtless and foolish towards themselves.

The captain sent for me, and told me that if I chose to take charge of her, as prize master, I might proceed to England direct. This plan exactly suited me, and I consented, only begging to have a boatswain's mate, named Thompson, to go along with me; he was an old shipmate, and had been one of my gig's crew when we had the affair in Basque Roads; he was a steady, resolute, quiet, sober, raw-boned Caledonian, from Aberdeen, and a man that I knew would stand by me in the hour of need. He was ordered to go with me, and the necessary supply of provisions and spirits were put on board.

I then went on deck, and seeing the whole of them, with their chests and bags, seated very quietly in the boat, and ready to shove off, I desired the captain and one of the American seamen to come on board again, and to bring their clothes with them. I did not remark the unwillingness of the captain to obey this order, until told of it by the midshipman; his chest and goods were immediately handed in upon deck, and the signal from the frigate being repeated, with a light for the boat to return (for it was now dark), she shoved off hastily, and was soon out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Stop the boat! for God's sake stop the boat!\" cried the captain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Why should I stop the boat?\" said I; \"my orders are positive, and you must remain with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI then went below for a minute or two, and the captain followed me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"As you value your life, sir,\" said he, \"stop the boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Why?\" asked I, eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Because, sir,\" said he, \"the ship has been scuttled by the men, and will sink in a few hours: you cannot save her, for you cannot get at her leaks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI now did indeed see the necessity of stopping the boat; but it was too late: she was out of sight. The lanthorn, the signal for her return, had been hauled down, a proof that she had got on board. I hoisted two lights at the mizen peak, and ordered a musket to be fired; but, unfortunately, the cartridges had either not been put in the boat which brought me, or they had been taken back in her. One of my lights went out; the other was not seen by the frigate. We hoisted another light, but it gained no notice: the ship had evidently made sail.

The poor black man, who had been left with the captain, was next consulted. All he knew was, that, when at Bordeaux, the captain had caused holes to be bored in the ship's bottom, that he might pull the plugs out whenever he liked, swearing, at the same time, that she never should enter a British port. He did not know where the leaks were situated, though it was evident to me that they were in the after and also in the fore parts of the ship, low down, and now deep under water, both inside as well as out.

Our clothes, bread, salt meat, and water, were put into her, with my sextant and spy-glass. The liquor, which was in the cabin, I gave in charge to the midshipman who was sent with me; and, having completely stowed our boat, and prepared her with a good lug-sail, we made her fast with a couple of stout tow-ropes, and veered her astern, with four men in her, keeping on our course in the supposed track of the frigate till daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThat wished-for hour arrived, but no frigate was to be seen, even from the mast-head. The ship was getting deeper and deeper, and we prepared to take to the boat. I calculated the nearest part of South America to be seven hundred miles from us, and that we were more than twice that distance from Rio Janeiro. I did not, however, despond, for, under all circumstances, we were extremely well off: and I inspired the men with so much confidence, that they obeyed in everything, with the utmost alacrity and cheerfulness, except in one single point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eFinding the ship could not in all probability float more than an hour or two, I determined to quit her, and ordered the boat alongside. The men got into her, stepped the mast, hooked on the lug-sail, ready to hoist at my orders; and, without my bidding, had spread my boat cloak in the stern-sheets, and made a comfortable place for me to repose in. The master proceeded to get into the boat, but the men repulsed him with kicks, blows, and hisses, swearing most dreadfully that if he attempted to come in, they would throw him overboard. Although in some measure I participated in their angry feeling, yet I could not reconcile myself to leave a fellow-creature thus to perish, even in the pit which he had dug for others, and this too at a time when we needed every indulgence from the Almighty for ourselves, and every assistance from his hand to conduct us into a port.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"He deserves to die; it is all his own doings,\" said they; \"come into the boat yourself, Sir, or we must shove off without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe poor captain—who, after sleeping four hours, had recovered his senses, and felt all the horror of his situation—wept, screamed, tore his hair, laid hold of my coat, from which only the strength of my men could disengage him.

He then fell into a fit of cursing and blasphemy, evidently bereft of his senses; and in this state he continued for some minutes, while we lay alongside, the bowman holding on with the boat-hook only. I was secretly determined not to leave him, although I foresaw a mutiny in the boat in consequence. At length, I gave the order to shove off. The unhappy captain, who, till that moment, might have entertained some faint hope from the lurking compassion which he perceived I felt for him, now resigned himself to despair of a more sullen and horrible aspect. He sat himself down on one of the hen-coops, and gazed on us with a ghastly eye.

Had I, indeed, ever seriously intended to leave him, the conduct of poor Mungo would have awakened me to a sense of my duty. I ordered Thompson, who was steering the boat, to put the helm a-starboard, and lay her alongside again. No sooner was this command given, than three or four of the men jumped up in a menacing attitude, and swore that they would not go back for him; that he was the cause of all their sufferings; and that if I chose to share his fate, I might, but into the boat he should not come. One of them, more daring than the rest, attempted to take the tiller out of Thompson's hand; but the trusty seaman seized him by the collar, and in an instant threw him overboard. The other men were coming aft to avenge this treatment of their leader; but I drew my sword, and pointing it at the breast of the nearest mutineer, desired him, on pain of instant death, to return to his seat. He had heard my character, and knew that I was not to be trifled with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eA mutineer is easily subdued with common firmness. He obeyed, but was very sullen, and I heard many mutinous expressions among the men.

I hold in my pocket a commission from the King's Lord High Admiral, or the commissioners for executing that duty. Your captain, and mine also, holds a similar commission. Under this authority I act. Let me see the man that dares dispute it—I will hang him at the yard-arm of the wreck before she goes down;\" and, looking at the man whom Thompson had thrown overboard, and who still held by the gunwale of the boat, without daring to get in, I asked him if he would obey me or not? He replied that he would, and hoped I would forgive him. I said that my forgiveness would depend entirely on the conduct of himself and the others; that he must recollect that if our own ship, or any other man-of-war, picked us up, he was liable, with three or four more, to be hanged for mutiny; and that nothing but his and their future obedience could save them from that punishment, whenever we reached a port.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis harangue had a very tranquillising effect.

I took advantage of this circumstance to read them a lecture. When I had subdued them, and worked a little on their feelings, I said I never knew any good come of cruelty: whenever a ship or a boat had left a man behind who might have been saved, that disaster or destruction had invariably attended those who had so cruelly acted; that I was quite sure we never should escape from this danger, if we did not show mercy to our fellow-creatures. \"God,\" said I, \"has shown mercy to us, in giving us this excellent boat, to save us in our imminent danger; and He seems to say to us now, 'Go back to the wreck, and rescue your fellow-sufferer.' The wind blows directly towards her, and is foul for the point in which we intend to steer; hasten, then,\" pursued I, \"obey the Divine will; do your duty, and trust in God. I shall then be proud to command you, and have no doubt of bringing you safe into port.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis was the \"pliant hour;\" they sprang upon their oars, and pulled back to the wreck with alacrity. The poor captain, who had witnessed all that passed, watched the progress of his cause with deep anxiety. No sooner did the boat touch the ship, than he leaped into her, fell down on his knees, and thanked God aloud for his deliverance. He then fell on my neck, embraced me, kissed my cheek, and wept like a girl. The sailors, meanwhile, who never bear malice long, good-naturedly jumped up, and assisted him in getting his little articles into the boat; and as Mungo followed his master, shook hands with him all round, and swore he should be a black prince when he went back to Guinea. We also took in one or two more little articles of general use, which had been forgotten in our former hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe now shoved off for the last time; and had not proceeded more than two hundred yards from the ship, when she gave a heavy lurch on one side, recovered it, and rolled as deep on the other; then, as if endued with life and instinct, gave, a pitch, and went down, head foremost, into the fathomless deep.

On the fifth day after leaving the wreck we discovered land at a great distance. I knew it to be the island of Trinidad and the rocks of Martin Vas. This island, which lies in latitude twenty degrees south, and longitude thirty degrees west, is not to be confounded with the island of the same name on the coast of Terra Firma, in the West Indies, and now a British colony.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eOn consulting Horseberg, which I had in the boat, I found that the island which we were now approaching was formerly inhabited by the Portuguese, but long since abandoned. I continued steering towards it during the night, until we heard the breakers roaring against the rocks, when I hove-to, to windward of the land, till daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe morning presented to our view a precipitous and rugged iron-bound coast, with high and pointed rocks, frowning defiance over the unappeaseable and furious waves which broke incessantly at their feet, and recoiled to repeat the blow. Thus for ages had they been employed, and thus for ages will they continue, without making any impression visible to the eye of man. To land was impossible on the part of the coast now under our inspection, and we coasted along, in hopes of finding some haven into which we might haul our boat, and secure her. The island appeared to be about nine miles long, evidently of volcanic formation, an assemblage of rocky mountains towering several hundred feet above the level of the sea. It was barren, except at the summit of the hills, where some trees formed a coronet, at once beautiful and refreshing, but tantalising to look at, as they appeared utterly inaccessible; and even supposing I could have discovered a landing-place, I was in great doubt whether I should have availed myself of it, as the island appeared to produce nothing which could have added to our comfort, while delay would only have uselessly consumed our provisions. There did not appear to be a living creature on the island, and the danger of approaching to find a landing-place was most imminent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis unpromising appearance induced me to propose that we should continue our course to Rio Janeiro. The men were of another opinion. They said they had been too long afloat, cooped up, and that they should prefer remaining on the island to risking their lives any longer, in so frail a boat, on the wide ocean. We were still debating, when we came to a small spot of sand, on which we discovered two wild hogs, which we conjectured had come down to feed on the shell fish; this decided them, and I consented to run to leeward of the island, and seek for a landing-place. We sounded the west end, following the remarks of Horseberg, and ran for the cove of the Nine-Pin Rock. As we opened it, a scene of grandeur presented itself, which we had never met with before, and which in its kind is probably unrivalled in nature. An enormous rock rose, nearly perpendicularly, out of the sea, to the height of nine hundred or one thousand feet. It was as narrow at the base as it was at the top, and was formed exactly in the shape of the nine-pin, from which, it derives its name. The sides appeared smooth and even to the top, which was covered with verdure, and was so far above us that the sea birds, which in myriads screamed around it, were scarcely visible two-thirds of the way up. The sea beat violently against its base—the feathered tribe, in endless variety, had been for ages the undisturbed tenants of this natural monument; all its jutting points and little projections were covered with their white dung, and it seemed to me a wonderful effort of Nature, which had placed this mass in the position which it held, in spite of the utmost efforts of the winds and waves of the wide ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAnother curious phenomenon appeared at the other end of the cove. The lava had poured down into the sea, and formed a stratum; a second river of fused rock had poured again over the first, and had cooled so rapidly as to hang suspended, not having joined the former strata, but leaving a vacuum between for the water to fill up. The sea dashed violently between the two beds, and spouted magnificently through holes in the upper bed of lava to the height of sixty feet, resembling much the spouting of a whale, but with a noise and force infinitely greater. The sound indeed was tremendous, hollow, and awful. I could not help mentally adoring the works of the Creator, and my heart sunk within me at my own insignificance, folly, and wickedness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAs we were now running along the shore, looking for our landing-place, and just going to take in the sail, the American captain, who sat close to the man at the helm, seemed attentively watching something on the larboard bow of the boat. In an instant he exclaimed, \"Put your helm, my good fellow, port-hard.\" These words he accompanied with a push of the helm so violent, as almost to throw the man overboard who sat on the larboard quarter. At the same moment, a heavy sea lifted the boat, and sent her many yards beyond, and to the right of a pointed rock, just flush or even with the water, which had escaped our notice, and which none suspected but the American captain (for these rocks do not show breakers every minute, if they did they would be easily avoided). On this we should most certainly have been dashed to pieces, had not the danger been seen and avoided by the sudden and skilful motion of the helm; one moment more, and one foot nearer, and we were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Merciful God!\" said I, \"to what fate am I reserved at last?

At the farther end of the cove, we discovered the wreck of a vessel lying on the beach. She was broken in two, and appeared to be copper-bottomed. This increased the eagerness of the men to land; we rowed close to the shore, but found that the boat would be dashed to pieces if we attempted it. The midshipman proposed that one of us should swim on shore, and, by ascending a hill, discover a place to lay the boat in. This I agreed to; and the quarter-master immediately threw off his clothes. I made a lead-line fast to him under his arms, that we might pull him in if we found him exhausted. He went over the surf with great ease, until he came to the breakers on the beach, through which he could not force his way; for the moment he touched the ground with his foot, the recoil of the sea, and what is called by sailors the undertow, carried him back again, and left him in the rear of the last wave.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThree times the brave fellow made the attempt, and with the same result. At last he sunk, and we pulled him in very nearly dead. We, however, restored him by care and attention, and he went again to his usual duty. The midshipman now proposed that he should try to swim through the surf without the line, for that alone had impeded the progress of the quarter-master; this was true, but I would not allow him to run the risk, and we pulled along shore, until we came to a rock on which the surf beat very high, and which we avoided in consequence. This rock we discovered to be detached from the main; and within it, to our great joy, we saw smooth water; we pulled in, and succeeded in landing without much difficulty, and having secured our boat to a grapnel, and left two trusty men in charge of her, I proceeded with the rest to explore the cove; our attention was naturally first directed to the wreck which we had passed in the boat, and, after a quarter of an hour's scrambling over huge fragments of broken rocks, which had been detached from the sides of the hill, and encumbered the beach, we arrived at the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe wreck proved to be a beautiful copper-bottomed schooner, of about a hundred and eighty tons burthen. She had been dashed on shore with great violence, and thrown many yards above the high-water mark. Her masts and spars were lying in all directions on the beach, which was strewed with her cargo. This consisted of a variety of toys and hardware, musical instruments, violins, flutes, fifes, and bird-organs. Some few remains of books, which I picked up, were French romances, with indelicate plates, and still worse text. These proved the vessel to be French. At a short distance from the wreck, on a rising knoll, we found three or four huts, rudely constructed out of the fragments; and, a little farther off, a succession of graves, each surmounted with a cross. I examined the huts, which contained some rude and simple relics of human tenancy: a few benches and tables, composed of boards roughly hewn out and nailed together; bones of goats, and of the wild hog, with the remains of burnt wood. But we could not discover any traces of the name of the vessel or owner; nor were there any names marked or cut on the boards, as might have been expected, to show to whom the vessel belonged, and what had become of the survivors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis studied concealment of all information led us to the most accurate knowledge of her port of departure, her destination, and her object of trade. Being on the south-west side of the island, with her head lying to the north-east, she had, beyond all doubt, been running from Rio Janeiro towards the coast of Africa, and got on shore in the night. That she was going to fetch a cargo of slaves was equally clear, not only from the baubles with which she was freighted but also from the interior fitting of the vessel, and from a number of hand and leg shackles which we found among the wreck, and which we knew were only used for the purposes of confining and securing the unhappy victims of this traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe took up our quarters in the huts for the night, and the next morning divided ourselves into three parties, to explore the island. I have before observed that we had muskets, but no powder, and therefore stood little chance of killing any of the goats or wild hogs, with which we found the island abounded. One party sought the means of attaining the highest summit of the island; another went along the shore to the westward; while myself and two others went to the eastward. We crossed several ravines, with much difficulty, until we reached a long valley, which seemed to intersect the island.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eHere a wonderful and most melancholy phenomenon arrested our attention. Thousands and thousands of trees covered the valley, each of them about thirty feet high; but every tree was dead, and extended its leafless boughs to another—a forest of desolation, as if nature had at some particular moment ceased to vegetate! There was no underwood or grass. On the lowest of the dead boughs, the gannets, and other sea birds, had built their nests in numbers unaccountable. Their tameness, as Cooper says, \"was shocking to me.\" So unaccustomed did they seem to man, that the mothers, brooding over their young, only opened their beaks, in a menacing attitude at us, as we passed by them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eHow to account satisfactorily for the simultaneous destruction of this vast forest of trees, was very difficult; there was no want of rich earth for nourishment of the roots. The most probable cause appeared to me, a sudden and continued eruption of sulphuric effluvia from the volcano; or else, by some unusually heavy gale of wind or hurricane, the trees had been drenched with salt water to their roots. One or the other of these causes must have produced the effect. The philosopher, or the geologist, must decide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe had the consolation to know that we should at least experience no want of food—the nests of the birds affording us a plentiful supply of eggs, and young ones of every age; with these we returned loaded to the cove. The party that had gone to the westward, reported having seen some wild hogs, but were unable to secure any of them; and those who had attempted to ascend the mountain, returned much fatigued, and one of their number missing. They reported that they had gained the summit of the mountain, where they had discovered a large plain, skirted by a species of fern tree, from twelve to eighteen feet high—that on this plain they had seen a herd of goats; and among them, could distinguish one of enormous size, which appeared to be their leader. He was as large as a pony; but all attempts to take one of them were utterly fruitless. The man who was missing had followed them farther than they had. They waited some time for his return; but as he did not come to them, they concluded he had taken some other route to the cove. I did not quite like this story, fearing some dreadful accident had befallen the poor fellow, for whom we kept a watch, and had a fire burning the whole night, which, like the former one, we passed in the huts. We had an abundant supply of fire-wood from the wreck, and a stream of clear water ran close by our little village.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe next morning, a party was sent in search of the man, and some were sent to fetch a supply of young gannets for our dinner. The latter brought back with them as many young birds as would suffice for two or three days; but of the three who went in quest of the missing man, only two returned. They reported that they could gain no tidings of him: that they had missed one of their own number, who had, no doubt, gone in pursuit of his shipmate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis intelligence occasioned a great deal of anxiety, and many surmises. The most prevalent opinion seemed to be that there were wild beasts on the island, and that our poor friends had become a prey to them. I determined, the next morning, to go in search of them myself, taking one or two chosen men with me. I should have mentioned, that when we left the sinking vessel, we had taken out a poodle dog, that was on board—first, because I would not allow the poor animal to perish; and, secondly, because we might, if we had no better food, make a dinner of him. This was quite fair, as charity begins at home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis faithful animal became much attached to me, from whom he invariably received his portion of food. He never quitted me, nor followed any one else; and he was my companion when I went on this excursion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe reached the summit of the first mountain, whence we saw the goats browsing on the second, and meant to go there in pursuit of the objects of our anxious search. I was some yards in advance of my companions, and the dog a little distance before me, near the shelving part of a rock, terminating in a precipice. The shelf I had to cross was about six or seven feet wide, and ten or twelve long, with a very little inclined plane towards the precipice, so that I thought it perfectly safe. A small rill of water trickled down from the rock above it, and, losing itself among the moss and grass, fell over the precipice below, which indeed was of a frightful depth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis causeway was to all appearance safe, compared with many which we had passed, and I was just going to step upon it, when my dog ran before me, jumped on the fatal pass—his feet slipped from under him—he fell, and disappeared over the precipice! I started back—I heard a heavy squelch and a howl; another fainter succeeded, and all was still. I advanced with the utmost caution to the edge of the precipice, where I discovered that the rill of water had nourished a short moss, close and smooth as velvet, and so slippery as not to admit of the lightest footstep; this accounted for the sudden disappearance, and, as I concluded, the inevitable death of my dog.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eMy first thoughts were those of gratitude for my miraculous escape; my second unwillingly glanced at the fate of my poor men, too probably lying lifeless at the foot of this mountain. I stated my fears to the two seamen who were with me, and who had just come up. The whole bore too much the appearance of truth to admit of a doubt. We descended the ruins by a circuitous and winding way; and, after an hour's difficult and dangerous walk, we reached the spot, where all our fears were too fully confirmed. There lay the two dead bodies of our companions, and that of my dog, all mangled in a shocking manner; both, it would appear, had attempted to cross the shelf in the same careless way which I was about to do, when Providence interposed the dog in my behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis singular dispensation was not lost upon me; indeed, latterly, I had been in such perils, and seen such hair-breadth escapes, that I became quite an altered and reflecting character. I returned to my men at the cove, thoughtful and melancholy; I told them of what had happened; and, having a Prayer-book with me in my trunk, I proposed to them that I should read the evening prayers, and a thanksgiving for our deliverance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eIn this, the American captain, whose name was Green, most heartily concurred. Indeed, ever since this poor man had been received into the boat, he had been a very different character to what I had at first supposed him; he constantly refused his allowance of spirits, giving it among the sailors; he was silent and meditative; I often found him in prayer, and on these occasions I never interrupted him. At other times, he studied how he might make himself most useful. He would patch and mend the people's clothes and shoes, or show them how to do it for themselves. Whenever any hard work was to be done, he was always the first to begin, and the last to leave off; and to such a degree did he carry his attention and kindness, that we all began to love him, and to treat him with great respect. He took charge of a watch when we were at sea, and never closed his eyes during his hour of duty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eNor was this the effect of fear, or the dread of ill-usage among so many Englishmen, whom his errors had led into so much misfortune. He very soon had an opportunity of proving that his altered conduct was the effect of sorrow and repentance. The next morning I sent a party round by the sea-shore, with directions to walk up the valley and bury the bodies of our unfortunate companions. The two men who had accompanied me were of the number sent on this service; when they returned, I pointed out to them how disastrous our residence had been on this fatal island, and how much better it had been for us if we had continued our course to Rio Janeiro, which, being only two hundred and fifty or two hundred and sixty leagues distant, we should by that time nearly have reached: that we were now expending the most valuable part of our provisions, namely—our spirits and tobacco; while our boat, our only hope and resource, was not even in safety, since a gale of wind might destroy her. I therefore proposed to make immediate preparations for our departure, to which all unanimously agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe divided the various occupations; some went to fetch a sea stock of young birds, which were killed and dressed to save our salt provisions; others filled all our water-casks. Captain Green superintended the rigging, sails, and oars of the boat, and saw that every thing was complete in that department. The spirits remaining were getting low, and Captain Green, the midshipman, and myself, agreed to drink none, but reserve it for pressing emergencies. In three days after beginning our preparations, and the seventh after our landing, we embarked, and after being nearly swamped by the surf, once more hoisted our sail on the wide waters of the Atlantic Ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe were not destined, however, to encounter many dangers this time, or to reach the coast of South America: for we had not been many hours at sea, when a vessel hove in sight; she proved to be an American privateer brig, of fourteen guns and one hundred and thirty men, bound on a cruise off the Cape of Good Hope. As soon as she perceived us, she bore down, and in half-an-hour we were safe on board; when having bundled all our little stock of goods on her decks, the boat was cut adrift. My men were not well treated until they consented to enter for the privateer, which, after much persuasion and threats, they all did, except Thompson, contrary to my strongest remonstrances, and urging every argument in my power to dissuade them from such a fatal step.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI remonstrated with the captain of the privateer, on what I deemed a violation of hospitality. \"You found me,\" I said, \"on the wide ocean, in a frail boat, which some huge wave might have overwhelmed in a moment, or some fish, in sport, might have tossed in the air. You received me and my people with all the kindness and friendship which we could desire; but you mar it, by seducing the men from their allegiance to their lawful sovereign, inducing them to become rebels, and subjecting them to a capital punishment whenever they may (as they most probably will) fall into the hands of their own government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe captain, who was an unpolished, but sensible, clearheaded Yankee, replied that he was sorry I should take any thing ill of him; that no affront was meant to me; that he had nothing whatever to do with my men, until they came voluntarily to him, and entered for his vessel; that he could not but admit, however, that they might have been persuaded to take this step by some of his own people. \"And, now, Leftenant,\" said he, \"let me ask you a question.

He never drank more than was sufficient to quench his thirst—he never swore—he never used any offensive language. He read the Scriptures constantly, was regular in his morning and evening devotion, and on every occasion of quarrel or ill-will in the brig, which was perpetually occurring, Green was the umpire and the peace-maker. He saved the captain and chief mate a world of trouble; by this system, violent language became uncommon on board, punishment was very rare, and very mild.

We hove off to the north or windward side of the island, about two miles from the shore; we dared not go nearer on that side, for fear of what are called the \"Rollers\"—a phenomenon, it would appear, of terrific magnitude, on that sequestered little spot. On this extraordinary operation of nature, many conjectures have been offered, but no good or satisfactory reason has ever been assigned to satisfy my mind; for the simple reason, that the same causes would produce the same effect on St Helena, Ascension, or any other island or promontory exposed to a wide expanse of water. I shall attempt to describe the scene that a succession of Rollers would present, supposing, what has indeed happened, that a vessel is caught on the coast when coming in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe water will be perfectly smooth—not a breath of wind—when, suddenly, from the north, comes rolling a huge wave, with a glassy surface, never breaking till it meets the resistance of the land, when it dashes down with a noise and a resistless violence that no art or effort of man could elude. It is succeeded by others. No anchorage would hold if there were anchorage to be had; but this is not the case; the water is from ninety to one hundred fathoms deep, and consequently an anchor and cable could scarcely afford a momentary check to any ship when thus assailed; or, if it did, the sea would, by being resisted, divide, break on board, and swamp her. Such was the fate of the unfortunate ——, a British sloop of war; which, after landing the captain and six men, was caught in the rollers, driven on shore, and every creature on board perished, only the captain and his boat's crew escaping. This unfortunate little vessel was lost, not from want of skill or seamanship in the captain or crew, for a finer set of men never swam salt water; but from their ignorance of this peculiarity of the island, unknown in any other that I ever heard of, at least to such an alarming extent. Driven close in to the land before she could find soundings, at last she let go three anchors; but nothing could withstand the force of the \"Rollers,\" which drove her in upon the beach, when she broke in two as soon as she landed, and all hands perished in sight of the affected captain and his boat's crew, who buried the bodies of their unfortunate shipmates as soon as the sea had delivered them up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThere is another remarkable peculiarity in this island: its shores, to a very considerable extent out to sea, are surrounded with the plant, called&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003efucus maximus\u003c/i\u003e, mentioned by Captain Cook; it grows to the depth of sixty fathoms, or one hundred and eighty feet, and reaches in one long stem to the surface, when it continues to run along to the enormous length of three or four hundred feet, with short alternate branches at every foot of its length. Thus, in the stormy ocean, grows a plant, higher and of greater length than any vegetable production of the surface of the earth, not excepting the banyan tree, which, as its branches touch the ground, takes fresh root, and may be said to form a separate tree. These marine plants resist the most powerful attacks of the mightiest elements combined; the winds and the waves in vain combine their force against them; uniting their foliage on the bosom of the waters, they laugh at the hurricane and defy its power. The leaves are alternate, and when the wind ruffles the water, they flap over, one after the other, with a mournful sound, doubly mournful to us from the sad association of ideas, and the loneliness of the island. The branches or tendrils of these plants are so strong and buoyant, when several of them happen to unite, that a boat cannot pass through them; I tried with my feet what pressure they would bear, and I was convinced that, with a pair of snow shoes, a man might walk over them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eCaptain Peters kindly invited me to go on shore with him.

I asked to be shown the spot where the —— was wrecked; he took me to her sad remains. She lay broken in pieces on the rocks; and, not far from her, was a mound of earth, on which was placed a painted piece of board by way of a tombstone. The fate of the vessel, together with the number of sufferers, were marked in rude but concise characters. I do not exactly remember the words, but in substance it stated, that underneath lay the remains of one hundred as fine fellows as ever walked on a plank, and that they had died, like British seamen, doing their duty to the last.

Now, if brother Jonathan had taken this island, I guess he would a' made it pay for its keep; he would have had two or three crews of whalers, with their wives and families, and all their little comforts about them, with a party of good farmers to till the land, and an officer to command the whole. The island can provide itself, as you may perceive, and all would have gone on well. It is just as easy to 'fish' the island from the shore as it is in vessel, and indeed much easier. Only land your boilers and casks, and a couple of dozen of good whale-boats, and this island would produce a revenue that would repay with profit all the money laid out upon it, for the sea-horses have no other place to go to, either to shed their coats in the autumn, or bring forth their young in the spring. The fishing and other duties would be a source of amusement to the sailors, who, if they chose, might return home occasionally in the vessels that came to take away the full casks of oil and land the empty ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe captain of the whaler returned to his ship, but, I suppose, forgot to give our captain very particular directions about the anchorage. We ran down to the east end of the island, and were just going to bring up, when, supposing himself too near the whaler, Peters chose to run a little further. I should have observed, that as we rounded the north-east point, the breeze freshed, and the squalls came heavy out of the gullies and deep ravines. We therefore shortened sail, and, passing very near the whaler, they hailed us; but it blew so fresh that we did not hear what they said; and, having increased our distance from the whaler to what was judged proper, let go the anchor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eNinety fathoms of cable ran out in a crack, before she turned head to-wind; and, to our mortification, we found we had passed the bank upon which the whaler had brought up, and must have dropped our anchor into a well, for we had nineteen fathoms water under the bows, and only seven fathoms under the stern.

He seldom complained to me, but sometimes vindicated himself by a gentle hint from one of his ample fists on the nose or eye of the offender, and here the matter usually ended, for his character was so simple and inoffensive, that all the best men in the vessel loved him. One night, a man fell overboard—the weather was fine, and the brig had but little way; they were lowering down the jolly-boat from the stern, when one of the hooks by which she hung by the stern, broke, and four men were precipitated with violence into the water. Two of them could not swim, and all screamed loudly for help as soon as they came up from their dive. Thompson, seeing this, darted from the stern like a Newfoundland dog, swam to the weakest, supported him to the rudder chains, and, leaving him, went to another, bringing him to the stern of the vessel, and making a rope fast under his arms. In this way he succeeded in saving the whole of these poor fellows. Two of the five would certainly have sank but for his timely assistance, for they were some time before another boat could be got ready; and the other three owned that they much doubted whether they could have reached the vessel without help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis conduct of Thompson was much applauded by all on board, and some asked him why he ventured his life for people who had used him so ill: he answered, that his mither and his Bible taught him to do all the good he could: and as God had given him a strong arm, he hoped he should always use it for the benefit of his brother in need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eIt might have been supposed that an act like this would have prevented the recurrence of any further insult; but the more the Americans perceived Thompson's value, the more eager were they to have him as their own.

When the story, however, came to be fairly explained, the captain said he was bound to confess that the second mate was the aggressor, inasmuch as he had acknowledged that he knew the penalty of the transgression before he committed the act; that he (the captain) had told Thompson, when he made the declaration, that he thought him perfectly right, and, consequently, he was bound to protect him by every law of hospitality as well as gratitude, after his services in saving the lives of their countrymen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis did not satisfy the crew; they were clamorous for punishment, and a mutiny was actually headed by the second mate.

He had gouged the eye out of a third, for some trifling difference of opinion. These acts obliged him to quit the country; for, not only were the officers of justice in pursuit of him, but the man who had lost one eye kept a sharp look out with the other, and Peleg would certainly have had a rifle ball in his ear if he had not fled eastward, and taken again to the sea, to which he was originally brought up. I did not know all his history till long after he and I became shipmates. He would have been tried for his life; but having made some prize money, he contrived to buy off his prosecutors.

Unluckily for him, the housemaid perceived the mistake which his absence of thought had led him into; and, snatching the mysterious vessel with her left hand, she hid it under her apron, while with her right she gave the poor fellow such a slap on the cheek, as to bring to my mind the tail of the whale descending on the boat at Bermuda. \"You great fool,\" said she, \"nobody wants that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"There is matrimony in that slap,\" said I; and the event proved I was right—they were&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003easked\u003c/i\u003e&nbsp;in church the Sunday following.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe industrious application of salts, cold water, and burnt rags, together with chafing of temples, opening of collars, and loosening the stay-laces of the young ladies, produced the happiest effects. Every hand, and every tongue was in motion; and with all these remedies, the eyes of the enchanting Emily opened, and beamed upon me, spreading joy and gladness over the face of creation, like the sun rising out of the bosom of the Atlantic, to cheer the inhabitants of the Antilles after a frightful hurricane. In half an hour, all was right; \"the guns were secured—we beat the retreat;\" the servants retired. I became the centre of the picture. Emily held my right, my father my left; dear Clara hung round my neck. Questions were put and answered as fast as sobs and tears would admit of their being heard. The interlude was filled up with the sweetest kisses from the rosiest of lips; and I was in this half hour rewarded for all I had suffered since I had sailed from England in the diabolical brig for Barbadoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eIt was, I own, exceedingly wrong to have taken the house, as it were, by storm, when I knew they were in mourning for me; but I forgot that other people did not require the same stimulus as myself.

That I felt gratitude to God for my deliverance and safe return, I do most solemnly aver; my heart was ready to burst with the escape of this feeling, which I suppressed from a false sense of shame, though I never was given much to the melting mood; moreover, I was too proud to show what I thought a weakness, before the great he-fellows of footmen. Had we been in private, I could have fallen down on my knees before that God whom I had so often offended; who had rescued me twice from the jaws of the shark; who had lifted me from the depth of the sea when darkness covered me; who had saved me from the poison and the wreck, and guided me clear of the rock at Trinidad; and who had sent the dog to save me from a horrible death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThese were only a small part of the mercies I had received; but they were the most recent, and consequently had left the deepest impression on my memory.

For the first time in my life, the love of God was mixed up with a pure and earthly love for Emily, and affection for my family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe ladies sat with us some time after the cloth was removed, unable to drag themselves away, while I related my \"hair-breadth escapes.\" When I spoke of the incident of trying to save the poor man who fell overboard from the brig—of my holding him by the collar, and being dragged down with him until the sea became dark over my head—Emily could bear it no longer; she jumped up, and falling on her knees, hid her lovely face in my sister's lap, passionately exclaiming, \"Oh, do not, do not, my dear Frank, tell me any more—I cannot bear it—indeed, I cannot bear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe all gathered round her, and supported her to the drawing-room, where we diverted ourselves with lighter and gayer anecdotes.

I was appointed to a ship fitting at Woolwich, and before she could be ready for sea, my time would be completed, and I was to have my commission as a commander.

This poetical imagery had no more effect on them, than my prose composition. I then appealed to Emily herself. \"Surely,\" said I, \"your heart is not as hard as those of our inflexible parents? surely you will be my advocate on this occasion?

Fortunately, the first lieutenant of the frigate was what we used to call \"a hard officer;\" he never went on shore, because he had few friends and less money. He drew for his pay on the day it became due, and it lasted till the next day of payment; and as I found he doated on a Spanish cigar, and a correct glass of cognac grog—for he never drank to excess—I presented him with a box of the former, and a dozen of the latter, to enable him to bear my nightly absence with Christian composure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAs soon as the day's work was ended, the good-natured lieutenant used to say, \"Come, Mr Mildmay, I know what it is to be in love; I was once in love myself, though it is a good many years ago, and I am sure I shall get into the good graces of your Polly (for so he called Emily) if I send you to her arms.

I generally got to Mr Somerville's temporary residence on Blackheath by the time the dressing-bell rang, and never failed to meet a pleasant party at dinner. My father and dear Clara were guests in the house as well as myself. By Mr Somerville's kind permission, I introduced Talbot, who, being a perfect gentleman in his manners, a man of sound sense, good education, and high aristocratic connections, I was proud to call my friend. I presented him particularly to my sister, and took an opportunity of whispering in Emily's ear, where I knew it would not long remain, that he possessed the indispensable qualification of two epaulettes. \"Therefore,\" said I, \"pray do not trust yourself too near him, for fear you should be taken by surprise, like the&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eTrue-blooded Yankee\u003c/i\u003e.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eTalbot knowing that Emily was bespoken, paid her no more than the common attentions which courtesy demands; but to Clara his demeanour was very different: and her natural attractions were much enhanced in his eyes, by the friendship which we had entertained for each other ever since the memorable affair of swimming away from the ship at Spithead; from that time he used jocularly to call me \"Leander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eBut before I proceed any further with this part of my history, I must beg leave to detain the reader one minute only, while I attempt to make a sketch of my dear little sister Clara. She was rather fair, with a fine, small, oval, well-proportioned face, sparkling black and speaking eyes, good teeth, pretty red lips, very dark hair, and plenty of it, hanging over her face and neck in curls of every size; her arms and bust were such as Phidias and Praxiteles might have copied; her waist was slender; her hands and feet small and beautiful. I used often to think it was a great pity that such a love as she was should not be matched with some equally good specimen of our sex; and I had long fixed on my friend Talbot as the person best adapted to command this pretty little, tight, fast-sailing, well-rigged smack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eUnluckily, Clara, with all her charms, had one fault, and that, in my eyes, was a very serious one. Clara did not love a sailor. The soldiers she doated on. But Clara's predilections were not easily overcome, and that which had once taken root grew up and flourished. She fancied sailors were not well bred; that they thought too much of themselves or their ships; and, in short, that they were as rough and unpolished as they were conceited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWith such obstinate and long-rooted prejudices against all of our profession, it proved no small share of merit in Talbot to overcome them. But as Clara's love for the army was more general than particular, Talbot had a vacant theatre to fight in. He began by handing her to dinner, and with modest assurance seated himself by her side. But so well was he aware of her failing, that he never once alluded to our unfortunate element; on the contrary, he led her away with every variety of topic which he found best suited to her taste: so that she was at last compelled to acknowledge that he might be one exception to her rule, and I took the liberty of hoping that I might be another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eOne day at dinner Talbot called me \"Leander,\" which instantly attracted the notice of the ladies, and an explanation was demanded; but for a time it was evaded, and the subject changed. Emily, however, joining together certain imperfect reports which had reached her ears, through the kindness of \"some friends of the family,\" began to suspect a rival, and the next morning examined me so closely on the subject, that fearing a disclosure from other quarters, I was compelled to make a confession.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI told her the whole history of my acquaintance with Eugenia, of my last interview, and of her mysterious departure.

I assured her that it was full four years and a half since we had met; and that as she knew of my engagement, it was unlikely we should ever meet again. \"At any rate,\" I said, \"I shall never seek her; and if accident should throw me in her way, I trust I shall behave like a man of honour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI did not think it necessary to inform her of the musket-shots fired at me by order of Talbot, as that might have injured him in the estimation of both Emily and Clara.

I had seen no captain yet, and the first lieutenant had gone on shore one morning to stretch his legs. I was commanding officer; the people were all at their dinner; it was a drizzling soft rain, and I was walking the quarter-deck by myself, when a shore-boat came alongside with a person in plain clothes.

As soon as we received our orders to proceed to Spithead, Mr Somerville, who had kept his house at Blackheath while the ship was fitting, in hopes that my promotion might have taken place before she was ready, now prepared to quit the place. To the renewed application of my father, the answer was that I must go abroad for my promotion. This at once decided him to break up his summer quarters, very wisely foreseeing that unless he did so, my services would be lost to my ship; and if he and Emily did not leave me behind at Woolwich, I should probably be left behind by my captain: he therefore announced his intended departure within twenty-four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eEmily was very sorry, and so was I. I kindly reproached her with her cruelty; but she replied with a degree of firmness and good sense, which I could not but admire, that she had but one counsellor, and that was her father, and that until she was married, she never intended to have any other; that by his advice she had delayed the union: and as we were neither of us very old people, \"I trust in God,\" said she, \"we may meet again.\" I admired her heroism, gave her one kiss, handed her into her carriage, and we shook hands. I need not say I saw a tear or two in her eyes. Mr Somerville saw the shower coming on, pulled up the glass, gave me a friendly nod, and the carriage drove off. The last I saw of Emily, at that time, was her right hand, which carried her handkerchief to her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAfter the dear inmates were gone, I turned from the door of the house in disgust, and ran direct to my boat, like a dog with a tin-kettle. When I got on board, I hated the sight of every body, and the smell of every thing; pitch, paint, bilge-water, tar and rum, entering into horrible combination, had conspired against me: and I was as sick and as miserable as the most love-sick seaman can conceive.

He was a smart, dapper, well made man, with a handsome, but not an intellectual countenance; cleanly and particular in his person; and, assisted by the puffs of Toady, had a very good opinion of himself; proud of his aristocratic birth, and still more vain of his personal appearance. His knowledge on most points was superficial—high life, and anecdotes connected with it, were the usual topics of his discourse; at his own table he generally engrossed all the conversation: and while his guests drank his wine, \"they laughed with counterfeited glee,\" &amp;c. His reading was comprised in two volumes octavo, being the Memoirs of the Count de Grammont, which amusing and aristocratical work was never out of his hand. He had been many years at sea; but strange to say, knew nothing, literally nothing, of his profession. Seamanship, navigation, and every thing connected with the service, he was perfectly ignorant of. I had heard him spoken of as a good officer, before he joined us; and I must, in justice to him, say that he was naturally good tempered, and I believe as brave a man as ever drew a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eHe seldom made any professional remark, being aware of his deficiency, and never ventured beyond his depth intentionally. When he came on the quarter-deck, he usually looked at the weather main-brace, and if it was not as taut as a bar, would order it to be made so. Here he could not easily commit himself: but it became a bye-word with us when we laughed at him below. He had a curious way of forgetting, or pretending to forget, the names of men and things, I presume, because they were so much beneath him; and in their stead, substituted the elegant phrases of \"What's-his-name,\" \"What-do-ye-call-'em,\" and \"thingumbob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eOne day he came on deck, and actually gave me the following very intelligible order. \"Mr, What's-his-name, have the goodness to—what-do-ye-call-'em,—the,—the thingumbob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Ay, ay, my lord,\" said I. \"Afterguard! haul taut the weather main-brace.\" This was exactly what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eHe was very particular and captious when not properly addressed.

The men were stamping aft, and the topsail yards travelling up to the mast-head very fast, when they were stopped by a sudden check with the fore-topsail haul-yards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"What's the matter?\" said the first lieutenant, calling to me, who was at my station on the forecastle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Something foul of the topsail-tie,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"What's the matter forward?\" said the captain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Topsail-tie is foul, my lord,\" answered the first lieutenant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"D—n the topsail-tie! cut it away.

Fortunately for them and for me, I was not long permitted to trifle away my time. We were ordered to cruise on the coast of North America. It was winter and very cold; we encountered many severe gales of wind, during which time we suffered much from the frequent and sudden snowstorms, north-east gales, and sharp frosts, which rendered our running-rigging almost unmanageable, and obliged us to pour boiling water into the sheaves of the blocks to thaw them, and allow the ropes to traverse; nor did the cold permit the captain to honour us with his presence on deck more than once in the twenty-four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe anchored off a part of the coast, which was not in a state of defence, and the people being unprotected by their own government, considered themselves as neutrals, and supplied us with as much fish, poultry, and vegetables, as we required. While we lay here, the captain and officers frequently went on shore for a short time without molestation. One night, after the captain had returned, a snow-storm and a gale of wind came on. The captain's gig, which ought to have been hoisted up, was not; she broke her painter, and went adrift, and had been gone some time before she was missed. The next morning, on making inquiry, it was found that the boat had drifted on shore a few miles from where we lay; and that having been taken possession of by the Americans, they had removed her to a hostile part of the coast, twenty-two miles off. The captain was very much annoyed at the loss of his boat, which he considered as his own private property, although built on board by the king's men, and with the king's plank and nails.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"As my private property,\" said his lordship, \"it ought to be given up, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI did not tell him that I had seen the sawyers cutting an anchor-stock into the plank of which it was built, and that the said plank had been put down to other services in the expense-book.

This was hardly completed, before the lieutenant came up again, and put a letter into my hands: which was no more than the very comfortable intelligence, that, on my return from the expedition on which I was then going, he should expect satisfaction for the affront I had offered him. I was glad, however, to find it was no worse. I laughed at his threat; and, as the very head and front of my offending was only having compared him to the captain, he could not show any resentment openly, for fear of displeasing his patron.

We had, however, no opportunity of trying our flag of truce, for as soon as we came within range of musket-shot, a volley from two hundred concealed militiamen struck down four of my men. There was then nothing left for it but to board, and bring out the vessels. Two of them were aground, and we set them on fire, it being dead low water (thanks to the delay in the morning): in doing this, we had more men wounded. I then took possession of the other two vessels, and giving one of them in charge of the midshipman, who was quite a lad, I desired him to weigh his anchor. I gave him the boat, with all the men except four, which I kept with me. The poor fellow probably lost more men, for he cut his cable, and got out before me. I weighed my anchor, but had one of my men killed by a musket ball in doing it. I stood out after the midshipman. We had gained an offing of four miles, when a violent gale and snow-storm came on. The sails belonging to the vessel all blew to rags immediately, being very old. I had no resource, except to anchor, which I did on a bank, in five fathom water. The other vessel lost all her sails, and, having no anchor, as I then conjectured, and afterwards learned, drifted on shore, and was dashed to pieces, the people being either frozen to death, wounded, or taken prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe next morning I could see the vessel lying on shore a wreck, covered with ice. A dismal prospect to me, as at that time I knew not what had become of the men. My own situation was even less enviable; the vessel was frail, and deeply laden with salt: a cargo, which, if it by any means gets wet, is worse than water, since it cannot be pumped out, and becomes as heavy as lead; nothing could, in that event, have kept the vessel afloat, and we had no boat in case of such an accident. I had three men with me, besides the dead body, in the cabin, and a pantry as clear as an empty house: not an article of any description to eat. I was four miles from the shore, in a heavy gale of wind, the pleasure of which was enhanced by snow, and the bitterest cold I ever experienced. We proceeded to examine the vessel, and found that there was on board a quantity of sails and canvas, that did not fit, but had been bought with an intention of making up for this vessel, and not before she wanted them; there was also an abundance of palms, needles, and twine; but to eat, there was nothing except salt, and to drink, nothing but one cask of fresh water. We kindled a fire in the cabin, and made ourselves as warm as we could, taking a view on deck now and then, to see if she drove, or if the gale abated. She pitched heavily, taking in whole seas over the forecastle, and the water froze on the deck. The next morning we found we had drifted a mile nearer to the shore, and the gale continued with unabated violence. The other vessel lay a wreck, with her masts gone, and as it were&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003ein terrorem\u003c/i\u003e, staring us in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe felt the most pinching hunger; we had no fuel after the second day, except what we pulled down from the bulkheads of the cabin. We amused ourselves below, making a suit of sails for the vessel, and drinking hot water to repel the cold. But this work could not have lasted long; the weather became more intensely cold, and twice did we set the prize on fire, in our liberality with the stove to keep ourselves warm. The ice formed on the surface of the water in our kettle, till it was dissolved by the heat from the bottom. The second night passed like the first; and we found, in the morning, that we had drifted within two miles of the shore. We completed our little sails this day, and with great difficulty contrived to bend them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe men were now exhausted with cold and hunger, and proposed that we should cut our cable and run on shore; but I begged them to wait till the next morning, as these gales seldom lasted long. This they agreed to: and we again huddled together to keep ourselves warm, the outside man pulling the dead man close to him by way of a blanket. The gale this night moderated, and towards the morning the weather was fine, although the wind was against us, and to beat her up to the ship was impossible. From the continued freezing of the water, the bob-stays and the rigging were coated with ice five or six inches thick, and the forecastle was covered with two feet of clear ice, showing the ropes coiled underneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThere was no more to be done: so, desiring the men to cut the cable, I made up my mind to run the vessel on shore, and give myself up. We hoisted the foresail, and I stood in with the intention of surrendering myself and people at a large town which I knew was situated about twelve miles farther on the coast. To have given myself up at the place where the vessels had been captured, I did not think would have been prudent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWhen we made sail on the third morning, we had drifted within half a mile of the shore, and very near the place we had left. Field pieces had been brought down to us. They had the range, but they could not reach us. I continued to make more sail, and to creep along shore, until I came within a few cables' length of the pier, where men, women, and children were assembled to see us land; when suddenly a snow-storm came on; the wind shifted, and blew with such violence, that I could neither see the port, nor turn the vessel to windward into it; and as I knew I could not hold my own, and that the wind was fair for our ship, then distant about forty miles, we agreed to up helm and scud for her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThis was well executed.

I was ordered down into the cabin, for it was too cold for the captain to show his face on deck. I found his lordship sitting before a good fire, with his toes in the grate; a decanter of Madeira stood on the table, with a wine glass, and most fortunately, though not intended for my use, a large rummer. This I seized with one hand and the decanter with the other; and, filling a bumper, swallowed it in a moment, without even drinking his lordship's good health. He stared, and I believe thought me mad. I certainly do own that my dress and appearance perfectly corresponded with my actions. I had not been washed, shaved, or \"cleaned,\" since I had left the ship, three days before. My beard was grown, my cheeks hollow, my eyes sunk, and for my stomach, I leave that to those fortunate Frenchmen who escaped from the Russian campaign, who only can appreciate my sufferings.

From this commanding eminence he now looked down on the housekeeper, whose nose could reach no higher than the seals of her adversary's watch; and in proportion as the baronet felt his security, so rose his choler. Having been for many years Proctor at the great universities of Point-street and Blue-town, as well as member of Barbican and North Corner, he was perfectly qualified, in point of classical dialect, to maintain the honour of his profession.

No doubt whatever that a broadside composed of such ingredients, would be a great desideratum in favour of a victory, especially if the enemy should happen to have none of his own to give in return.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSo thought his lordship, who walking up to the first lieutenant, said,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Mr Thingamay, don't you think red hot what-do-ye-call-ums should be given in the first broadside to that thingumbob?\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Red hot shot, do you mean, my lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Yes,\" said his lordship; \"don't you think they would settle his hash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Where the devil are we to get them, my lord?\" said the first lieutenant, who was not the same that wanted to fight me for saying he was as clever a fellow as the captain: that man had been unshipped by the machinations of Toady.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Very true,\" said his lordship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe now approached the stranger very fast, when, to our great mortification, she proved to be an English frigate; she made the private signal, it was answered; showed her number, we showed ours, and her captain being junior officer came on board, to pay his respects and show his order. He was three weeks from England, brought news of a peace with France, and, among other treats, a navy list, which, next to a bottle of London porter, is the greatest luxury to a sea officer in a foreign climate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eGreedily did we all run over this interesting little book, and among the names of the new made commanders, I was overjoyed to find my own; the last on the list to be sure, but that I cared not for.

I was also particularly anxious to return to England for many reasons, the hand of my dear Emily standing at the head of them. I therefore requested the captain's permission to quit the ship; and as he wished to give an acting order to one of his own followers, he consented. I took my leave of all my messmates, and of my captain, who, though an unfeeling coxcomb and no sailor, certainly had some good points about him: in fact, his lordship was a gentleman; and had his ship fallen in with an enemy, she would have been well fought, as he had good officers, was sufficiently aware of his own incapability, would take advice, and as a man of undaunted bravery, was not to be surpassed in the service.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eOn the third day after our arrival, the frigate sailed. I went on board the slaver, which had no slaves on board except four to assist in working the vessel; she was in a filthy state, and there was no inn on shore, and of course no remedy. Port Praya is the only good anchorage in the island; the old town of St Jago was deserted, in consequence of there being only an open roadstead before it, very unsafe for vessels to lie in. The town of Port Praya is a miserable assemblage of mud huts; the governor's house, and one more, are better built, but they are not so comfortable as a cottage in England. There were not ten Portuguese on the island, and above ten thousand blacks, all originally slaves; and yet every thing was peaceable, although fresh arrivals of slaves came every day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eIt was easy to distinguish the different races: the Yatoffes are tall men, not very stoutly built; most of them are soldiers. I have seen ten of them standing together, the lowest not less than six feet two or three inches. The Foulahs, from the Ashantee country, are another race, they are powerful and muscular, ill-featured, badly disposed, and treacherous. The Mandingoes are a smaller race than the others, but they are well disposed and tractable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe island of slaves is kept in subjection by slaves only, who are enrolled as soldiers, miserably equipped; a cap and a jacket was all they owed to art, nature provided the rest of their uniform.

After a few French compliments, I took my leave. I was curious to see the old town of St Jago, which had been abandoned; and after a hot walk of two hours over uncultivated ground, covered with fine goats, which are the staple of the island, I reached the desolate spot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eIt was melancholy to behold: it seemed as if the human race were extinct. The town was built on a wide ravine running down to the sea; the houses were of stone, and handsome; the streets regular and paved, which proves that it had formerly been a place of some importance; but it is surprising that a spot so barren as this island generally is should ever have had any mercantile prosperity. Whatever it did enjoy, I should conceive must have been anterior to the Portuguese having sailed round the Cape of Good Hope; and the solidity and even elegance of construction among the buildings justifies the supposition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe walls were massive, and remained entire; the churches were numerous, but the roofs of them and the dwelling-houses had mostly fallen in. Trees had grown to a considerable height in the midst of the streets, piercing through the pavements and raising the stones on each side; and the convent gardens were a mere wilderness. The cocoa-nut tree had thrust its head through many a roof, and its long stems through the tops of the houses; the banana luxuriated out of the windows. The only inhabitants of a town capable of containing ten thousand inhabitants, were a few friars who resided in a miserable ruin which had once been a beautiful convent. They were the first negro friars I had ever seen; their cowls were as black as their faces, and their hair grey and woolly. I concluded they had adopted this mode of life as being the laziest; but I could not discover by what means they could gain a livelihood, for there were none to give them anything in charity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe appearance of these poor men added infinitely to the necromantic character of the whole melancholy scene. There was a beauty, a loveliness, in these venerable ruins, which delighted me. There was a solemn silence in the town; but there was a small, still voice, that said to me: \"London may one day be the same—and Paris; and you and your children's children will all have lived and had their loves and adventures; but who will the wretched man be, that shall sit on the summit of Primrose Hill, and look down upon the desolation of the mighty city, as I, from this little eminence, behold the once flourishing town of St Jago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe goats were browsing on the side of the hill, and the little kids frisking by their dams. \"These,\" thought I, \"perhaps are the only food and nourishment of these poor friars.\" I walked to Port Praya, and returned to my floating prison, the slave ship. The officer who was conducting her home, as a prize, was not a pleasant man; I did not like him: and nothing passed between us but common civility. He was an old master's mate, who had probably served his time thrice over; but having no merit of his own, and no friends to cause that defect to be overlooked, he had never obtained promotion: he therefore naturally looked on a young commander with envy. He had only given me a passage home, from motives which he could not resist; first, because he was forced to obey the orders of my late captain; and, secondly, because my purse would supply the cabin with the necessary stock of refreshments, in the shape of fruit, poultry, and vegetables, which are to be procured at Port Praya; he was therefore under the necessity of enduring my company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe vessel, I found, was not to sail on the following day, as he intended. I therefore took my gun, at daybreak, and wandered with a guide up the valleys, in search of the pintados, or Guinea fowl, with which the island abounds; but they were so shy that I never could get a shot at them; and I returned over the hills, which my guide assured me was the shortest way. Tired with my walk, I was not sorry to arrive at a sheltered valley, where the palmetto and the plantain offer a friendly shade from the burning sun. The guide, with wonderful agility, mounted the cocoa-nut tree, and threw down half a dozen nuts. They were green, and their milk I thought the most refreshing and delicious draught I had ever taken.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe vesper bells at Port Praya were now summoning the poor black friars to their devotion; and a stir and bustle appeared among the little black boys and girls, of whose presence I was till then ignorant. They ran from the coverts, and assembled near the front of the only cottage visible to my eye. A tall elderly negro man came out, and took his seat on a mound of turf a few feet from the cottage; he was followed by a lad, about twenty years of age, who bore in his hand a formidable cowskin. For the information of my readers, I must observe that a cowskin is a large whip, made like a riding whip, out of the hide of the hippopotamus, or sea-cow, and is proverbial for the severity of punishment it is capable of inflicting. After the executioner came, with slow and measured steps, the poor little culprits, five boys and three girls, who, with most rueful faces, ranged themselves, rank and file, before the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI soon perceived that the hands were turned up for punishment; but the nature of the offence I had yet to learn: nor did I know whether any order had been given to strip. With the boys this would have been supererogatory, as they were quite naked. The female children had on cotton chemises, which they slowly and reluctantly rolled up, until they had gathered them close under their armpits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe old man then ordered the eldest boy to begin his Pater Noster; and simultaneously the whipper-in elevated his cowskin by way of encouragement. The poor boy watched it, out of the corner of his eye, and then began \"Pattery nobstur, qui, qui, qui—(here he received a most severe lash from the cowskin bearer)—is in silly,\" roared the boy, as if the continuation had been expelled from his mouth by the application of external force in an opposite direction—\"sancty fisheter nom tum, adveny regnum tum, fi notun tas, ta, ti, tu, terror,\" roared the poor fellow, as he saw the lash descending on his defenceless back—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Terror indeed,\" thought I.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Pannum nossum quotditty hamminum da nobs holyday, e missy nobs debitty nossa si cut nos demittimissibus debetenibas nossimus e, ne, nos hem-duckam in, in, in temptationemum, sed lillibery nos a ma—ma—\" Here a heavy lash brought the very Oh! that was \"caret\" to complete the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eMy readers are not to suppose that the rest of the class acquitted themselves with as much ability as their leader, who, compared to them, was perfectly erudite; the others received a lash for every word, or nearly so. The boys were first disposed of, in order, I suppose, that they might have the full benefit of the applicant's muscles; while the poor girls had the additional pleasure of witnessing the castigation until their turn came; and that they were aware of what awaited them was evident, from their previous arrangement and disposition of dress, at the commencement of the entertainment. The girls accordingly came up one after another to say their Ave Maria, as more consonant to their sex; but I could scarcely contain my rage when the rascally cowskin was applied to them, or my laughter when, smarting under its lash, they exclaimed, \"Benedicta Mulieribus,\" applying their little hands with immoderate pressure to the afflicted part.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI could have found in my heart to have wrested the whip out of the hands of the young negro, and applied it with all my might to him, and his old villain of a master, and father of these poor children, as I soon found he was. My patience was almost gone when the second girl received a lash for her \"Plena Gratia.\" She screamed, and danced, and lifted up her poor legs in agony, rubbing herself on her \"west\" side, as the Philadelphia ladies call it, with as much assiduity as if it had been one of those cases in which friction is prescribed by the faculty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eBut the climax was yet to come. A grand stage effect was to be produced before the falling of the curtain. The youngest girl was so defective in her lesson, that not one word of it could be extracted from her, even by the cowskin; nothing but piercing shrieks, enough to make my heart bleed, could the poor victim utter.

By the simplest and easiest means I have known all your movements—your dangers, your escapes, your undaunted acts of bravery and self-devotion for the sake of others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"'Shall I then,' said I to myself, 'blast the prospects of the man I love—the father of my boy? Shall I, to gratify the poor, pitiful ambition of becoming the wife of him, to whom I once was the mistress, sacrifice thus the hopes and fortune of himself and family, the reward of a virtuous maiden?' In all this I hope you will perceive a proper share of self-denial. Many, many floods of bitter tears of repentance and regret have I shed over my past conduct; and I trust, that what I have suffered and what I shall suffer, will be received as my atonement at the Throne of Grace. True, I once looked forward to the happy period of our union, when I might have offered myself to you, not as a portionless bride; but I was checked by one maddening, burning, inextingishable thought. I could not be received into that society to which you were entitled. I felt that I loved you, Frank; loved you too well to betray you. The woman that had so little respect for herself, was unfit to be the wife of Francis Mildmay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Besides, how could I do my sweet boy the injustice to allow him to have brothers and sisters possessing legitimate advantages over him? I felt that our union never could be one of happiness, even if you consented to take me as your wife, of which I had my doubts; and when I discovered, through my emissaries, that you were on the point of marriage with Miss Somerville, I felt that it was all for the best; that I had no right to complain; the more so as it was I who (I blush to say it) had seduced you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"But, Frank, if I cannot be your wife—and alas!

But there the sacred line is drawn; it is a compact between my God and myself. You know my firmness and decision; once maturely deliberated, my resolution formed, it is not, I think, in man to turn me. Do not, therefore, make the attempt; it will only end in your certain defeat and shame, and in my withdrawing from your sight for ever. You will not, I am sure, pay me so bad a compliment as to wish me to renew the follies of my youth. If you love me, respect me; promise, by the love you bear to Miss Somerville, and your affection for this poor boy, that you will do as I wish you.

As if a mirror had been held up to me, I saw my own deformity. I saw that Eugenia was not only the guardian of her own honour, but of mine, and of the happiness of Miss Somerville, against whom I now stood convicted of foul deceit and shameful wrong. I acknowledged my fault, I assured Eugenia that I was bound to her, by every tie of honour, esteem, and love; and that her boy and mine should be our mutual care.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Thank you, dearest,\" said she: \"you have taken a heavy load from my mind: henceforth remember we are brother and sister.

It was only so at times, and from peculiar circumstances; but I was always generous, and easily recalled to a sense of my duty, when reminded of my fault. Not for an empire would I have persuaded Eugenia to break her vow. I loved and respected the mother of my child; the more when I reflected that she had been the means of preserving my fidelity to Emily. I rejoiced to think that my friendship for the one, and love for the other, were not incompatible. I wrote immediately to Emily, announcing my speedy return to England.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Having the most perfect reliance on your honour, I shall now,\" said Eugenia, \"accept of your escort to London, where my presence is required.

The house was given up—a roomy travelling barouche received all our trunks; and, seated by the side of Eugenia, with the child between us, we crossed the Gironde, and took our way through Poictiers, Tours, and Orleans, to Paris; here we remained but a short time. Neither of us were pleased with the manners and habits of the French; but as they have been so fully described by the swarms of English travellers who have infested that country with their presence, and this with the fruits of their labours, I shall pass as quietly through France, as I hope to do through the Thames Tunnel, when it is completed, but not before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eEugenia consulted me as to her future residence; and here I own I committed a great error, but, I declare to Heaven, without any criminal intention. I ventured to suggest that she should live in a very pretty village a few miles from —— Hall, the residence of Mr Somerville, and where, after my marriage, it was intended that I should continue to reside with Emily. To this village, then, I directed her to go, assuring her that I should often ride over and visit her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Much as I should enjoy your company, Frank,\" said Eugenia, \"this is a measure fraught with evil to all parties; nor is it fair dealing towards your future wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eUnhappily for me, that turn for duplicity, which I had imbibed in early life, had not forsaken me, notwithstanding the warnings I had received, and the promises of amendment which I had made. Flattering myself that I intended no harm, I overruled all the scruples of the excellent Eugenia. She despatched a confidential person to the village; on the outskirts of which, he procured for her a commodious, and even elegant cottage ornée ready furnished. She went down with her child and Pierre to take possession; and I to my father's house, where my appearance was hailed as a signal for a grand jubilee.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eClara I found had entirely changed her unfavourable opinion of sea officers, induced thereto by the engaging manners of my friend Talbot, on whom I was delighted to learn she was about to bestow her very pretty little white hand at the altar.

My father was particularly liberal to Emily in the articles of plate and jewellery, and Mr Somerville equally kind to Clara. Emily received a trinket box, so beautifully fitted and so well filled, that it required a cheque of no trifling magnitude to cry quits with the jeweller; indeed my father's kindness was so great, that I was forced to beg he would set some bounds to his liberality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI was so busy and so happy, that I had let three weeks pass over my head without seeing Eugenia.

She received me kindly, but she had suffered in her health, and was much out of spirits. I inquired the reason, and she burst into tears. \"I shall be better, Frank,\" said she, \"when all is over, but I must suffer now; and I suffer the more acutely from a conviction that I am only paying the penalty of my own crime. Perhaps,\" continued she, \"had I never departed from virtue, I might at this moment have held in your heart the envied place of Miss Somerville; but as the righteous decrees of Providence having provided punishment to tread fast in the footsteps of guilt, I am now expiating my faults, and I have a presentiment that although the struggle is bitter, it will soon be over.

To her natural beauty was added on that fatal day a morning dress, which more than any other became her; it was white, richly trimmed, and fashionably made up by a celebrated French milliner. Her bonnet was white muslin, trimmed with light blue ribbons, and a sash of the same colour confined her slender waist. The little Eugenio ran before us, now at my side, and now at his mother's. We rambled about for some time, the burthen of our conversation being the future plans and mode of education to be adopted for the child; this was a subject on which she always dwelt with peculiar pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eTired with our walk, we sat down under a clump of beech trees, near a grassy ascent, winding among the thick foliage, contrived by the opulent owner to extend and diversify the rides in his noble domain.

They neither breathed nor moved; even their very horses seemed to be of bronze, or, perhaps the unfortunate situation in which I found myself made me think them so. They had come as unexpectedly on us as we had discovered them. The soft turf had received the impression of their horses' feet, and returned no sound; and if they snorted, we had either not attended to them in the warmth of our conversation, or we had never heard them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI rose up hastily—coloured deeply—stammered, and was about to speak.

She only replied with tears. I quitted her and the child without bidding them adieu, little thinking I should never see them again. I ran to the inn, where I had left my horse, mounted, and rode back to —— Hall. Mr Somerville and his daughter had just arrived, and Emily was lifted off her horse, and obliged to be carried up to her room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eClara and Talbot came to enquire what had happened. I could give no account of it; but earnestly requested to see Emily. The answer returned was that Miss Somerville declined seeing me. In the course of this day, which, in point of mental suffering, exceeded all I had ever endured in the utmost severity of professional hardship, an explanation had taken place between myself, my father, and Mr Somerville. I had done that by the impulse of dire necessity which I ought to have done at first of my own free will. I was caught at last in my own snare. \"The trains of the devil are long,\" said I to myself, \"but they are sure to blow up at last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe consequence of the explanation was my final dismissal, and a return of all the presents which my father and myself had given to Emily. My conduct, though blamable, was not viewed in that heinous light, either by my father or Mr Somerville; and both of them did all that could be done to restore harmony. Clara and Talbot interposed their kind offices, but with no better success. The maiden pride of the inexorable Emily had been alarmed by a beautiful rival, with a young family, in the next village. The impression had taken hold of her spotless mind, and could not be removed. I was false, fickle, and deceitful, and was given to understand that Miss Somerville did not intend to quit her room until she was assured by her father that I was no longer a guest in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eUnder these painful circumstances, our remaining any longer at the Hall was both useless and irksome—a source of misery to all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eMy father ordered his horses the next morning, and I was carried back to London, more dead than alive.

I had taken no medicine but from her hand. I asked her to give me some account of what had happened. She told me that Talbot was gone—that my father had seen Mr Somerville, who had informed him that Emily had received a long letter from Eugenia, narrating every circumstance, exculpating me, and accusing herself. Emily had wept over it, but still remained firm in her resolution never to see me more—\"And I am afraid, my dear brother,\" said Clara, \"that her resolution will not be very easily altered. You know her character, and you should know something about our sex; but sailors, they say, go round the world without going into it. This is the only shadow of an excuse I can form for you, much as I love and esteem you. You have hurt Emily in the nicest point, that in which we are all the most susceptible of injury. You have wounded her pride, which our sex rarely, if ever, forgive. At the very moment she supposed you were devoted to her—that you were wrapped up in the anticipation of calling her your own, and counting the minutes with impatience until the happy day arrived; with all this persuasion on her mind, she comes upon you, as the traveller out of the wood suddenly comes upon the poisonous snake in his path, and cannot avoid it. She found you locked hand-in-hand with another, a fortnight before marriage, and with the fruits of unlawful love in your arms. What woman could forgive this? I would not, I assure you. If Tal——, I mean if any man were to serve me so, I would tear him from my heart, even if the dissolution of the whole frame was to be the certain consequence. I consider it a kindness to tell you, Frank, that you have no hope. Much as you have and will suffer, she, poor girl, will suffer more; and, although she will never accept you, she will not let your place be supplied by another, but sink, broken-hearted, into her grave. You, like all other men, will forget this; but what a warning ought it to be to you, that, sooner or later, guilt will be productive of misery! This you have fully proved: your licentious conduct with this woman has ruined her peace for ever, and Divine vengeance has dashed from your lips the cup which contained as much happiness as this world could afford: nor has the penalty fallen on you alone—the innocent, who had no share in the crime, are partakers in the punishment; we are all as miserable as yourself. But God's will be done,\" continued she, as she kissed my aching forehead, and her tears fell on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eHow heavenly is the love of a sister towards a brother!

The first was, to ask his friends at the Admiralty to give me the command of a sloop of war; the second, that I should go upon the continent, and, having passed a year there, return to England, when there was no knowing what change of sentiment time and absence might not produce in my favour. \"For,\" said he, \"there is one very remarkable difference in the heart of a man and of a woman. In the first, absence is very often a cure for love. In the other, it more frequently cements and consolidates it.

I set off unknown to my family; and contrived to be near the boundaries of the park by dusk. I desired the postboy to stop half a mile from the house, and to wait my return. I cleared the paling; and, avoiding the direct road, came up to the house. The room usually occupied by the family was on the ground floor, and I cautiously approached the window. Mr Somerville and Emily were both there. He was reading aloud; she sat at the table with a book before her: but her thoughts, it was evident, were not there; she had inserted her taper fingers into the ringlets of her hair, until the palms of her hand reached her forehead; then, bending her head towards the table, she leaned on her elbows, and seemed absorbed in the most melancholy reflections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"This, too, is my work,\" said I; \"this fair flower is blighted, and withering by the contagious touch of my baneful hand.

Happiness? no, no—that I have lost for ever. Would that my loss were all! would that comfort might visit the soul of this fair creature and another. But I dare not—I cannot pray; I am at enmity with God and man. Yet I will make an effort in favour of this victim of my baseness. O God,\" continued I, \"if the prayers of an outcast like me can find acceptance, not for myself, but for her, I ask that peace which the world cannot give; shower down thy blessings upon her, alleviate her sorrows, and erase from her memory the existence of such a being as myself.

It did not, however; for I fell, and lay on the turf in a state of insensibility, which must have lasted nearly half an hour. I afterwards learned from Clara, that Emily had opened the window, it being a French one, to walk out and recover herself. By the bright moon-light, she perceived me lying on the ground. Her first idea was, that I had committed suicide; and, with this impression, she shut the window, and tottering to the back part of the room, fainted. Her father ran to her assistance, and she fell into his arms. She was taken up to her room, and consigned to the care of her woman, who put her to bed; but she was unable to give any account of herself, or the cause of her disorder, until the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eFor my own part, I gradually came to my senses, and with difficulty regained my chaise, the driver of which told me I had been gone about an hour. I drove off to town, wholly unaware that I had been observed by any one, much less by Emily. When she related to her father what she had seen, he either disbelieved or affected to disbelieve it, and treated it as the effects of a distempered mind, the phantoms of a disordered imagination; and she at length began to coincide with him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI started for the continent a few days afterwards. Talbot, who had seen little of Clara since my rejection by Emily, and subsequent illness, offered my father to accompany me; and Clara was anxious that he should go, as she was determined not to listen to any thing he could say during my affliction; she could not, she said, be happy while I was miserable, and gave him no opportunity of conversing with her on the subject of their union.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWe arrived at Paris; but so abstracted was I in thought, that I neither saw nor heard any thing. Every attention of Talbot was lost upon me. I continued in my sullen stupor, and forgot to read the little book which dear Clara had given, and which, for her sake, I had promised to read. I wrote to Eugenia on my arrival; and disburthened my mind in some measure, by acknowledging my shameful treatment of her. I implored her pardon; and, by return of post, received it. Her answer was affectionate and consoling; but she stated that her spirits, of course, were low, and her health but indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eFor many days my mind remained in a state, of listless inanity; and Talbot applied, or suffered others to apply, the most pernicious stimulant that could be thought of to rouse me to action. Taking a quiet walk with him, we met some friends of his; and, at their request, we agreed to go to the saloons of the Palais Royal. This was a desperate remedy, and by a miracle only was I saved from utter and irretrievable ruin. How many of my countrymen have fallen victims to the arts practised in that horrible school of vice, I dare not say! Happy should I be to think that the infection had not reached our own shores, and found patrons among the great men of the land. They have, however, both felt the consequences, and been forewarned of the danger.&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThey\u003c/i\u003e&nbsp;have no excuse:&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003emine\u003c/i\u003e&nbsp;was, that I had been excluded from the society of those I loved.

I won considerably; and night after night found me at the table—for avarice is insatiable; but my good luck left me: and then the same motive induced me to return, with the hope of winning back what I had lost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eStill fortune was unpropitious, and I lost very considerable sums. I became desperate; and drew largely on my father. He wrote to beg that I would be more moderate; as twice his income would not support such an expenditure. He wrote also to Talbot, who informed him in what manner the money had been expended; and that he had in vain endeavoured to divert me from the fatal practice. Finding that no limits were likely to be put to my folly, my father very properly refused to honour any more of my bills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eMaddened with this intimation, for which I secretly blamed Talbot, I drew upon Eugenia's banker bill after bill, until the sum amounted to more than what my father had paid.

Indeed, before I had read these letters, my mind did not need this damning proof of his innocence and my guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eJust as I had finished reading, the&nbsp;\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003egens d'armes\u003c/i\u003e&nbsp;entered my room, and, with the officers of justice, led me away to prison.

My amusement was climbing the most frightful precipices, followed by the large and faithful dogs, and viewing nature in her wildest and most sublime attire. At other times, when bodily fatigue required rest, I sat down, with morbid melancholy, in the receptacle for the bodies of those unfortunate persons who had perished in the snow. There would I remain for hours, musing on their fate: the purity of the air admitted neither putrefaction, or even decay, for a very considerable time; and they lay, to all appearance, as if the breath had even then only quitted them, although, on touching those who had been there for years, they would often crumble into dust.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eRoman Catholics, we know, are ever anxious to make converts.

Her letter concluded incoherently; and although I should have said, in the morning, that my mind had not room for another sorrow, yet the loss of this sweet boy, and the state of his wretched mother, found a place in my bosom for a time, to the total exclusion of all other cares.

She had been seized with a brain fever, and had died at a small town in Norfolk, where she had removed soon after our last unhappy interview.

In the midst of this devastation, I looked around me, and the only object which presented itself to my mind, as worthy of contemplation, was the tomb which contained the remains of Eugenia and her child. To that I resolved to repair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"__center_block\" style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; display: table; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px auto; max-width: 70%; padding: 0px; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; width: auto;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14.4px; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 17.28px; margin: 0px; padding: 0.5em 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"poem\" style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWith sorrow and repentance true,\u003cbr /\u003eFather, I trembling come to you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px -2em 0px 0px; padding: 0em 0px 0px; text-align: right; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003ci style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSong.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background: none; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: small-caps; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI arrived\u003c/span\u003e&nbsp;at the town where poor Eugenia had breathed her last, and near to which was the cemetery in which her remains were deposited. I went to the inn, whence, after having dismissed my post-boy and ordered my luggage to be taken up to my room, I proceeded on foot towards the spot. I was informed that the path lay between the church and the bishop's palace. I soon reached it; and, inquiring for the sexton, who lived in a cottage hard by, requested he would lead me to a certain grave, which I indicated by tokens too easily known.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Oh, you mean the sweet young lady, as died of grief for the loss of her little boy.

The bird remained, but without dressing its plumage, without the usual air of surprise and vigilance evinced by domestic fowls, when disturbed in their haunts. This poor creature was moulting; its feathers were rumpled and disordered; its tail ragged. There was no beauty in the animal, which was probably only kept as a variety of the species; and it appeared to me as if it had been placed there as a lesson to myself. In its modest attire, in its melancholy and pensive attitude, it seemed, with its gaudy plumage, to have dismissed the world and its vanities, while in mournful silence it surveyed the crowded mementoes of eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"This is my office, not thine,\" said I, apostrophising the bird, which, alarmed at my near approach, quitted its position, and disappeared among the surrounding tombs. I sat down, and fixing my eyes on the name which the tablet bore, ran over, in a hurried manner, all that part of my career which had been more immediately connected with the history of Eugenia. I remembered her many virtues; her self-devotion for my honour and happiness; her concealing herself from me, that I might not blast my prospects in life by continuing an intimacy which she saw would end in my ruin; her firmness of character, her disinterested generosity, and the refinement of attachment which made her prefer misery and solitude to her own gratification in the society of the man she loved. She had, alas! but one fault, and that fault was loving me. I could not drive from my thoughts, that it was through my unfortunate and illicit connection with her that I had lost all that made life dear to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAt this moment (and not once since the morning I awoke from it) my singular dream recurred to my mind. The thoughts which never had once during my eventful voyage from the Bahamas to the Cape, and thence to England, presented themselves in my waking hours, must certainly have possessed my brain during sleep. Why else should it never have occurred to my rational mind that the connection with Eugenia would certainly endanger that intended with Emily? It was Eugenia that placed Emily in mourning, out of my reach, and, as it were, on the top of the Nine-Pin Rock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eHere, then, my dream was explained; and I now felt all the horrors of that reality which I thought at the time was no more than the effect of a disordered imagination. Yet I could not blame Eugenia; the poor girl had fallen a victim to that deplorable and sensual education which I had received in the cockpit of a man-of-war. I, I alone was the culprit. She was friendless, and without a parent to guide her youthful steps; she fell a victim to my ungoverned passions. Maddened with anguish of head and heart, I threw myself violently on the grave: I beat my miserable head against the tombstones; I called with frantic exclamation on the name of Eugenia; and at length sank on the turf, between the two graves, in a state of stupor and exhaustion, from which a copious flood of tears in some measure relieved me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI was aroused by the sound of wheels and the trampling of horses; and, looking up, I perceived the bishop's carriage and four, with out-riders, pass by. The livery and colour of the carriage were certainly what is denominated quiet; but there was an appearance of state which indicated that the owner had not entirely \"renounced the pomps and vanities of this wicked world,\" and my spleen was excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"Ay, sweep along,\" I bitterly muttered, \"worthy type indeed of the apostles!

I rang loudly and vehemently at the gate, and asked whether the bishop was at home. An elderly domestic, who seemed to regard me with astonishment, answered in the affirmative, and desired me to walk into an ante-room, while he announced me to his master.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eI now began to recall my scattered senses, which had been wandering, and to perceive the absurdity of my conduct; I was therefore about to quit the palace, into which I had so rudely intruded, without waiting for my audience, when the servant opened the door and requested me to follow him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eBy what inscrutable means are the designs of Providence brought about!

He returned exactly at the end of three days, and after a short examination, said he would allow me to receive the sacrament, and that the holy ceremony should take place in his own room privately, well knowing how much affected I should be. He brought in the bread and wine; and having consecrated and partaken of them himself, agreeably to the forms prescribed, he made a short extempore prayer in my behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eWhen he had done this, he advanced towards me, and presented the bread.

I felt that I had faith—that I was a new man—and that my sins were forgiven; and, dropping my head on the side of the table, I remained some minutes in grateful and fervent prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe service being ended, I hastened to express my acknowledgments to my venerable friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003e\"I am but the humble instrument, my dear young friend,\" said the bishop; \"let us both give thanks to the almighty Searcher of hearts.

Bending beneath age and infirmity, he had undertaken a journey of three hundred miles, in order to ensure the temporal as well as eternal welfare of a perfect stranger—to effect a reconciliation, without which he saw that my worldly happiness was incomplete. I was afterwards informed, that notwithstanding the weight of his character and holy office, he had found Emily more decided in her rejection than he had anticipated; and it was not until he had sharply rebuked her for her pride and unforgiving temper, that she could be brought to listen with patience to his arguments. But having at length convinced her that the tenure of her own hopes depended on her forgiveness of others, she relented, acknowledged the truth of his remarks, and her undiminished affection for me. While she made this confession, she was in the same position before the bishop, that I was when I received her letter—on my knees, and in tears.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; color: #202122; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-stretch: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-numeric: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px 1em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eHe gave me his hand, raised me up, \"And, now, my young friend,\" said he, \"let me give you one caution.
